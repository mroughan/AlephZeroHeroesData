You\u2019re supposed to be in Moscow.\nDr. Hank Pym: I took a detour. [he places a vial containing a red serum on the table] Through your defense lab.\nPeggy Carter: Tell me that isn\u2019t what I think it is.\nDr. Hank Pym: It depends, if you think it\u2019s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve.\nMitchell Carson: You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you\u2019re a soldier\u2026\nDr. Hank Pym: I\u2019m a scientist.\nHoward Stark: Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed, help us put it to good use.\nDr. Hank Pym: I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research?\nMitchell Carson: If only you\u2019d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.\nDr. Hank Pym: Oh, god. [suddenly Pym slams down Carson\u2019s face on the table in anger, Peggy pulls him away]\nPeggy Carter: Easy, Hank.\nDr. Hank Pym: You mention my wife again and I\u2019ll show you ferocity. [Carson looks at Stark as he wipes blood from his nose]\nHoward Stark: Don\u2019t look at me, you said it.\nDr. Hank Pym: I formally tender my resignation.\nHoward Stark: We don\u2019t accept it. Formally. Hank, we need you. The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please, don\u2019t let your past determine the future.\nDr. Hank Pym: As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula. [Pym turns around and leaves calmly]\nMitchell Carson: We shouldn\u2019t let him leave the building.\nPeggy Carter: You\u2019ve already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?\nMitchell Carson: Yes! Our scientists haven\u2019t come close to replicating his work.\nHoward Stark: He just kicked your ass full size. You really want to find out what it\u2019s like when you can\u2019t see him coming? I\u2019ve known Hank Pym for a long time, he\u2019s no security risk. Unless we make him one.\n\n[Music plays as MARVEL appears on the screen]\n[Present Day \u2013 Scott Lang is in prison getting punched in the face by another prisoner, Peachy]\nPeachy: You like that? You like that? Come get you some then! [the other prisoners are gathered around them cheering them along]\n\u00a0 \u00a0 [Scott tries to hit Peachy in the stomach but he doesn\u2019t flinch]\nScott Lang: You didn\u2019t even move.\nPeachy: Nah.\nScott Lang: I mean, what if I come in on the left side, right? Just out here and see this here\u2026 [suddenly Scott punches Peachy in the face]\nPeachy: I\u2019m gonna miss you, Scott.\nScott Lang: I\u2019m gonna miss you too, Peachy.

His going away present.\nLuis: Oh, yeah, I still got my scar from a year ago.\nScott Lang: Oh yeah.\nLuis: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know what? I\u2019m still the only one to knock him out.\nScott Lang: Well, I definitely didn\u2019t.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 [they get into Luis\u2019s truck and drive off]\n[as Luis drives him home]\nScott Lang: Thanks for picking me up, brother.\nLuis: Oh, you know, you think I\u2019m gonna miss my cellie getting out?\nScott Lang: Hey, how\u2019s your girl, man?\nLuis: Uh, she left me.\nScott Lang: Oh.\nLuis: Yeah, my mom died too. And my dad got deported. But I got the van!\nScott Lang: It\u2019s nice!\nLuis: Yeah, right?\nScott Lang: Thanks for the hook-up too. I needed a place to stay.\nLuis: You wait \u2018til you see this couch, you\u2019re gonna be really happy. You\u2019re gonna be on your feet in no time, watch.\nScott Lang: I hope so.\nLuis: Yeah. And I gotta introduce you to some people, some really skilled people.\nScott Lang: Not interested.\nLuis: Yeah right!\nScott Lang: No, I\u2019m serious, man. I\u2019m not going back. I got a daughter to take care of.\nLuis: You know that jobs don\u2019t come easy for ex-cons, right?\nScott Lang: Look man, I got a masters in electrical engineering, alright? I\u2019m gonna be fine.\n[we see Scott working at Baskin Robbins]\nScott Lang: Welcome to Baskin Robbins. Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?\nIce Cream Store Customer: Uh, no thanks. Um, I will have\u2026 I\u2019ll have a burger, please.\nScott Lang: Oh, we don\u2019t\u2026 we don\u2019t make that.\nIce Cream Store Customer: Pretzel. Hot pretzel, like, mustard\u2026 in mustard dip?\nScott Lang: It\u2019s ice cream. Baskin Robbins.\nIce Cream Store Customer: I\u2019ll just do with whatever\u2019s hot and fresh.\nScott Lang: Dude.\n[Scott\u2019s boss, Dale interrupts him serving the idiot customer]\nDale: Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.\nScott Lang: Sure thing, Dale. Darby, could you just, uh\u2026 [points to the customer] \u2026take care of this idiot? Thanks.\n[Scott enters Dale\u2019s office]\nScott Lang: Hiya, Dale.\nDale: Come on in. Pull up some chair.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 [Scott sits down]\nDale: Three years in San Quentin, huh?\nScott Lang: You found out.\nDale: Baskin Robbins always finds out.\nScott Lang: Look, I\u2019m sorry, alright, but I\u2026 no one would hire me.\nDale: Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.\nScott Lang: Look, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, I\u2026 you know, it was\u2026 I don\u2019t do it anymore. I\u2019m just trying\u2026\nDale: Respect. I couldn\u2019t be happier about it.\nScott Lang: Really?\nDale: Yeah, yeah.\nScott Lang: Oh, thank you, thank you.\nDale: You really stuck it to those billionaire S.O.Bs. And the more I read about what you did and stuff, I\u2019m like, \u201cWow, I know this guy? I\u2019m in charge of this guy?\u201d Yeesh!\nScott Lang: Well, I\u2019m very happy in this job, and I\u2019m\u2026 I really just appreciate the opportunities and\u2026\nDale: Yeah, yeah. Well, you\u2019re fired of course. I mean, I can\u2019t really keep you on.\nScott Lang: Wait, what? Fired?\nDale: Yeah.\nScott Lang: Dale, look, it wasn\u2019t a violent crime, I mean, I\u2019m a good worker.\nDale: No, it wasn\u2019t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I\u2019ll tell you what, though, this\u2019d be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh\u2026 if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I\u2019ll just pretend I didn\u2019t see it.\n[after getting fired from Baskin Robbins, Scott returns to the Luis\u2019s apartment]\nLuis: Hey, Scotty, what\u2019s up? I thought you were supposed to be at work?\nScott Lang: I was, I got fired.\nLuis: Damn! They find out who you are?\nScott Lang: Yep.\nLuis: Baskin Robbins always finds out, bro.\nDave: Baskin Robbins don\u2019t play.\nLuis: You want some waffles?\nScott Lang: Yeah, I\u2019ll take a waffle.\nLuis: Oh. That\u2019s Kurt. He was in Folsom for 5 years, he\u2019s a wizard on that laptop.\nKurt: Nice to meet you.\nScott Lang: Yeah, nice to meet you too. [to Dave] And who are you?\nDave: Dave. Nice work on the Vista job.\nKurt: Vista job? Yes. No, no, I have heard of this robbery.\nScott Lang: Well, technically, I didn\u2019t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence, I burgled them. I\u2019m a cat burglar.\nDave: You mean you\u2019re a pussy?\nScott Lang: Yeah.\nLuis: They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system, and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.\nDave: Posts all the bank records online.\nLuis: And he drove dude\u2019s Bentley into a swimming pool.\nScott Lang: What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life\u2019s story to these guys? What do you want?\nLuis: Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago about this little, perfect job.\nScott Lang: No way.\nLuis: No, no, no. Wait! This guy\u2026 this guy fits your M.O.\nScott Lang: No! I\u2019m finished man. I\u2019m not going back to jail.\nLuis: It\u2019s some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute, It\u2019s a perfect Scott Lang mark.\nScott Lang: I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m out.\n[Pym drives up to Pym Technologies]\n\nPym Tech Gate Guard: Dr. Pym?\nDr. Hank Pym: Yes. I\u2019m still alive.\n\u00a0 [the guard smiles and lets Pym drive through the gate, Pym then enters the building]\nPym Tech Security Guard: I.D.\nDr. Hank Pym: [referring to the massive painting of Pym in his younger days hanging behind the guard] Perhaps that will suffice.\nPym Tech Security Guard: I\u2019m very sorry, sir. Please come in.\nPym Tech Employee: Is that Hank Pym?\nHope van Dyne: Good morning, Hank.\nDr. Hank Pym: Hope. Would it kill you to call me dad?\nHope van Dyne: Well, Dr. Cross will be so please that you could find the time to join us today.\nDarren Cross: More like, thrilled.\n[Cross walks over to Pym and shakes his hand]\nDr. Hank Pym: I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren. What\u2019s the occasion?\nDarren Cross: Oh, you\u2019ll see. Won\u2019t he, Hope?\n[Hope gives Pym a cold look]\nHope van Dyne: We\u2019re ready for you inside.\n[Hope walks away]\nDarren Cross: Ouch. [referring to Hope] I guess some old wounds never heal, huh? Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019s in good hands. You\u2019re in for a treat.\n[Carson comes over to Pym as they are about to enter the lab]\nCarson: Long time no see, Dr. Pym. How\u2019s retirement? [they shake hands]\nDr. Hank Pym: How\u2019s your face?\n[Carson enters the lab]\nHope van Dyne: After you.\n[Pym enters the lab]\nDarren Cross: Now before we start I\u2019d like to introduce a very special guest, this company\u2019s founder and my mentor, Dr. Hank Pym. [everyone in the lab claps, at the same time Pym notices the miniature building of Pym Technologies has now got the logo Cross Technologies on it] When I took over this company for Dr. Pym, I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank\u2019s research, I couldn\u2019t tell you. But just imagine. A soldier the size of an insect. The ultimate secret weapon. [he shows everyone footage reel of soldiers getting killed but with a tiny costumed figure also every footage] An \u201cAnt-Man\u201d. [pointing to Pym] That\u2019s what they called you. Right, Hank? Silly, I know. Propaganda. Tales to astonish. Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R. Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you, was the Ant-Man real?\nDr. Hank Pym: Just a tall tale.\nDarren Cross: Right. Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real? [Cross leads everyone into another room] Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man. And with my breakthrough, shrinking inorganic material, I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person? Could that be done? Well, it\u2019s not a legend anymore. Distinguished guests, I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it: the Yellowjacket. [he shows them a yellow insect sized suit] The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage. [he puts on a video]\nVideo Voice Over: We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance. It\u2019s time to return to a simpler age. One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests. An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel. The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the Geo-political landscape, completely unseen. Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault. Practical applications include: surveillance, industrial sabotage, and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace. A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world. The Yellowjacket.\nFrank: So it\u2019s a suit.\nDarren Cross: Don\u2019t be crude, Frank. It\u2019s not a suit, it\u2019s a\u2026 it\u2019s a vessel. What\u2019s a matter, you\u2019re not impressed?\nFrank: Oh, I\u2019m impressed. I\u2019m also concerned. Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.\nDarren Cross: We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank. I really value your opinion. Thank you for coming. Hope?\nHope van Dyne: Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now. Thank you.\nDarren Cross: You seem a bit shocked.\n[as everyone leaves the room Pym walks over to Cross]\nDr. Hank Pym: Darren, there\u2019s a reason that I buried these secrets.\nDarren Cross: So you finally admit it. We could\u2019ve done this together, Hank. But you ruined that. That\u2019s why you\u2019re the past and I\u2019m the future.\nDr. Hank Pym: Don\u2019t do this.\nMitchell Carson: Dr. Cross. [Cross goes over to Carson] You sell to me first, twenty percent of your asking price, I can have the cash here in two weeks.\nDarren Cross: Deal.\nHope van Dyne: [after everyone leaves Cross\u2019 presentation Hope goes over to Pym] We have to make our move, Hank.\nDr. Hank Pym: How close is he?\nHope van Dyne: He still can\u2019t shrink a live subject. Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.\nDr. Hank Pym: No.\nHope van Dyne: I have Cross\u2019 complete trust.\nDr. Hank Pym: It\u2019s too dangerous.\nHope van Dyne: We don\u2019t have a choice.\nDr. Hank Pym: Well, that\u2019s not entirely true.\nHope van Dyne: I think I found a guy.\nDr. Hank Pym: Who?\n\n[Scott shows up at his daughter\u2019s birthday party]\n\nCassie Lang: Daddy!\n[she rushes towards Scott, he catches Cassie in his arms and embraces her]\nScott Lang: Peanut! Oh! Happy birthday! I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m late, I didn\u2019t know what time your party started.\nCassie Lang: It was on the invitation!\n[Scott\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Paxton interrupts them]\nPaxton: He didn\u2019t get an invitation! But he came anyway.\nScott Lang: Well, I\u2019m not going to miss my little girl\u2019s birthday party.\nCassie Lang: I\u2019m gonna go tell mommy you\u2019re here.\nScott Lang: Oh, you don\u2019t\u2026\n[Cassie turns and runs off]\nPaxton: What are you doing here, Lang? You haven\u2019t paid a dime in child support. You know, right now if I wanted to, I could arrest you.\nScott Lang: It\u2019s good to see you too, Paxton.\n[Cassie comes back]\nCassie Lang: Mommy\u2019s so happy you\u2019re here, she choked on her drink.\nScott Lang: Hey, look what I have for you.\n[he hands her the small bag he\u2019d brought]\nCassie Lang: Can I open it now?\nPaxton: Of course sweetheart, it\u2019s your birthday.\n[she takes out an ugly looking rabbit which talks]\nHideous Rabbit: You\u2019re my bestest friend!\nPaxton: [referring to the toy rabbit] What is that thing?\nCassie Lang: He\u2019s so ugly! I love him! Can I go show my friends?\nPaxton: Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.\n[Cassie runs off with the ugly rabbit to show her friends]\nHideous Rabbit: You\u2019re my bestest friend!\nScott Lang: Look, the child support is coming. Alright? It\u2019s just hard finding a job when you have a record.\nPaxton: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure it out, but for now I want you out of my house.\nScott Lang: No, wait, it\u2019s my daughter\u2019s birthday!\nPaxton: It\u2019s my house!\nScott Lang: So what, it\u2019s my kid!\n[Maggie walks over to them]\nMaggie Lang: Scott! You can\u2019t just show up here, you know that. Come on.\nScott Lang: It\u2019s her birthday party.\nMaggie Lang: Yeah, I know, but you can\u2019t just show up.\nScott Lang: She\u2019s my daughter.\nPaxton: You don\u2019t know the first thing about being a father.\nScott Lang: Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life, your fianc\u00e9 is an ass-hat.\nMaggie Lang: He\u2019s not an ass-hat.\nPaxton: Hey, watch your language. Okay?\nScott Lang: Oh, what language. I said hat.\n[Maggie takes Scott out of the house]\nScott Lang: Really, Maggie? That guy? Come on, you could marry anyone you want, you have to get engaged to a cop?\nMaggie Lang: At least he\u2019s not a crook.\nScott Lang: I\u2019m trying, okay? I\u2019ve changed, and I\u2019m straight, I had a job, and\u2026 I want to provide. I had a lot of time to think about it, and I love her. So much. I\u2019ve missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life. What do I do?\nMaggie Lang: Get an apartment. Get a job, pay child support. And then we will talk about visitation, I promise. You\u2019re her hero, Scott. Just, be the person that she already thinks you are.\n[Scott gets into Luis\u2019s van, Cassie waves goodbye to him as he drives off honking the musical horn]\n\n[Frank is in the bathroom taking a leak]\n\nDarren Cross: I\u2019m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.\n[Frank turns back in surprise to find Cross standing there watching him]\nFrank: Yeah, well, uh, unfortunately we can\u2019t just do whatever we want. Would be nice though, right?\n[he chuckles as he washes his hands]\nFrank: But there are laws.\nDarren Cross: What laws? Of man? The laws of nature transcend the laws of man, and I\u2019ve transcended the laws of nature.\nFrank: Darren, I don\u2019t think you understand\u2026\n[suddenly Cross uses a small device on Frank which vaporizes him into a blob of goo]\nDarren Cross: Hm. We still haven\u2019t worked out all the bugs.\n[Cross uses a tissue to wipe the goo off the sink and dumps it into one of the toilets]\nDarren Cross: Goodbye, Frank.\n[he flushes the toilet and washes his hands]\n\n[Cross and Hope are having dinner at a restaurant]\n\nDarren Cross: You know I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately, and today during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me and I think it might apply to you too.\nHope van Dyne: How\u2019s that?\nDarren Cross: Gratitude can be forgiveness. I spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym. I devoted my genius to him. I could\u2019ve worked anywhere. I chose my mentor poorly. You didn\u2019t even have a choice. He never believed in you. It\u2019s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn\u2019t he? But we shouldn\u2019t be angry, we should be grateful. Because his failures as a mentor, as a father, forced us to spread our wings.\nHope van Dyne: You\u2019re a success, Darren. You deserve everything coming your way.\n\n[after sitting outside in the van trying to figure how many days he\u2019s got left to see Cassie again, Scott returns to Luis\u2019s apartment]\n\nLuis: Hey, what\u2019s up, hotshot?\n[Scott doesn\u2019t reply]\nDave: Maybe he didn\u2019t hear you.\nLuis: How was the party?\n[Scott goes to the fridge, takes out a beer bottle and takes a swig from it]\nScott Lang: Tell me about that tip.\nLuis: What?\nScott Lang: I want to know about that tip.\nLuis: Ooh, baby, it\u2019s on!\nDave: Hot dog!\nLuis: It\u2019s so on right now!\nDave: Look who grew a pair!\nScott Lang: Calm down, alright? I just need to know where it came from, it\u2019s gotta be airtight.\nLuis: Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto, which was mainly reds, and you know I don\u2019t love reds man, you know? But there was a ros\u00e9 that saved the day, it was delightful. And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with, it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched.\nScott Lang: It\u2019s the wrong details. It\u2019s wrong\u2026 It has nothing to do with the story. Go!\nLuis: So, uh, he tells me that she\u2019s working as a housekeeper now, right? And she\u2019s dating this dude Carlos who\u2019s a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about the dude that she\u2019s cleaning for. Right? That he\u2019s, like, this big-shot CEO that is all retired now but he\u2019s loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says: \u201cYo, man. This guy\u2019s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chillin\u2019.\u201d Of course Ernesto comes to me cause he knows I\u2019ve got mad thieving skills. Of course I ask him: \u201cDid Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was? And he says: \u201cNah, dog. All she said is that it\u2019s, like, super legit, and whatever\u2019s in it has gotta be good!\nScott Lang: What?\nKurt: Old man have safe.\nLuis: And he\u2019s gone for a week.\nScott Lang: Alright. There\u2019s an old man, he\u2019s got a safe, and he\u2019s gone for a week. Let\u2019s just work with that.\nLuis: Y\u2019know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\n\n[we see the group getting prepared and gathering the right gear for the robbery]\n\nKurt: Landlines cut, cell signals jammed. No one will be making for distress call tonight.\nLuis: All check.\nKurt: Check.\nDave: Check.\nLuis: If the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?\nScott Lang: Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not gonna happen. [Scott leaves the van]\nLuis: I love it when he gets cocky. [as they guys stay in the van they watch Scott hop the fence into the house]\nDave: Damn! [through his earpiece] Alarm is dead.\nLuis: Nice!\nScott Lang: Alright, I\u2019m moving through the house.\n[inside the house Scott finds a door with a thumbprint scanner]\nScott Lang: There\u2019s a fingerprint lock on the door.\nLuis: It\u2019s got a what? Ernesto didn\u2019t tell me nothin\u2019 about that. Aw, man, are we screwed?\nScott Lang: Not necessarily.\n[Scott quickly uses several household items to get a fingerprint from a door knob and uses that to successfully pass the thumbprint scanner]\nScott Lang: I\u2019m in.\nKurt: No alarms have been triggered. He\u2019s in like the Flynn.\n[Scott opens the door and immediately sees the safe made of strong metal]\nScott Lang: Oh, man.\nLuis: What is it?\nScott Lang: Well they weren\u2019t kidding, this safe is serious.\nLuis: How serious we talkin\u2019, Scotty?\nScott Lang: It\u2019s a Carbondale. It\u2019s from 1910, made from the same steel as the Titanic.\nLuis: Wow. Can you crack it?\nScott Lang: Well, here\u2019s the thing. It doesn\u2019t do so well in the cold. Remember what that iceberg did?\nLuis: Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.\nDave: It killed everybody.\nKurt: But not the old lady. She still threw the jewel into the oceans.\n[Scott gets to work to try and open the safe]\nLuis: What are you doing?\nScott Lang: I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen. Ice expands, metal doesn\u2019t.\nLuis: What are you doing now?\nScott Lang: Waiting. Waiting.\n[the safe door breaks open]\nScott: Nice.\n[Scott looks inside the safe]\nLuis: What is it, cash? Jewels?\nScott Lang: Well there\u2019s nothing here.\nLuis: What\u2019d you say?\n[Scott notices some blueprints and the original Ant-Man suit]\nScott Lang: It\u2019s a suit.\nLuis: What?\nScott Lang: It\u2019s an old motorcycle suit.\nLuis: There\u2019s no cash, no jewelry, nothing?\nScott Lang: No. It\u2019s a bust.\nLuis: I\u2019m really sorry, Scotty. I know you needed a score.\n[we see an ant with a camera on its back nearby recording Scott take the suit, inside his lab Hank is watching Scott]\n\n[back at Pym Technologies Cross is about to perform the shrinking experiments with a lamb]\n\nHope van Dyne: I thought we were using mice?\nDarren Cross: What\u2019s the difference? Commence experiment 34C, organic atomic reduction.\nHope van Dyne: Darren, maybe we should think\u2026\nDarren Cross: Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology. I can\u2019t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.\n[Cross initiates the experiment and the lamb is vaporized to goo to Hope\u2019s shock]\nDarren Cross: Experiment 34C results: Negative. [to the lab tech] Sanitize the workstation, bring in subject 35C.\n\n[back at Luis\u2019s apartment in the bathroom, Scott looks at the suit he took from the safe]\n\nScott Lang: Why would you lock this up?\n[he takes out the suit and looks at the helmet]\nScott Lang: So weird.\n[he tries the suit on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror]\nLuis: Scott, what\u2019s up man?\n[Scott closes the shower curtain then looks at the buttons on the gloves]\nScott Lang: I wonder\u2026 what is this?\n[he presses the buttons and shrinks down to a tiny size]\n[in his tiny form Scott stand and looks around him in shock, Scott then hears Hank\u2019s voice speaking through the mask]\nDr. Hank Pym: The world sure seems different from down here, doesn\u2019t it, Scott?\nScott Lang: What? Who\u2026 who said that?\n[Scott sees Luis open the shower curtains to take a shower]\nScott Lang: Luis! Luis, down here!\nDr. Hank Pym: It\u2019s a trial by fire, Scott. Or in this case, water.\n[Luis turns on the water, after getting splashed around Scott falls out of the bathtub and onto the floor]\nDr. Hank Pym: Guess you\u2019re tougher than you thought.\n[Scott hears Luis about to get undressed]\nScott Lang: Oh, I don\u2019t want to see this.\n[as Luis drops his trousers onto the floor it knocks Scott through a hole in the apartment below]\nScott Lang: Luis! Ahh! Son of a\u2026\u00a0!\n[Scott falls into an apartment where a party is going on, he narrowly avoids getting stepped on before falling through the vent into another apartment gets sucked into a hoover, breaks out, encounters a mouse, then runs into a trap and is launched out the window where he returns to his normal size on top of a cab]\nCab Driver: What the hell?\nDr. Hank Pym: Not bad for a test drive. Keep the suit, I\u2019ll be in touch.\nScott Lang: No, no. No, thank you.\n\n[Scott packs the suit up and sneaks it back into house and returns it into the safe, but the police are waiting for him as he goes to leave]\n\nCop on Speaker: Put it down on the ground! You are under arrest!\nScott Lang: No, I didn\u2019t steal anything! I was returning something I stole.\n[Scott realizes he\u2019s admitted to stealing and reluctantly kneels on the ground as he\u2019s arrested]\n\n[Paxton visits Scott as he\u2019s sat in his cell]\n\nPaxton: You know, you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your ways. They were really rooting for you. It\u2019s gonna break their hearts.\nDetective: You got a visitor.\nScott Lang: Who?\nDetective: Your lawyer.\nScott Lang: My lawyer?\n[Scott is taken to a room where Pym is sat waiting for him]\nDr. Hank Pym: I told you I\u2019d be in touch, Scott. I\u2019m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.\nScott Lang: Oh, man.\nDr. Hank Pym: Sit down.\n[we see ants crawling over the camera in the room to obscure the conversation]\nScott Lang: Sir, I\u2019m sorry I stole the suit. I don\u2019t even want to know why you have it.\nDr. Hank Pym: Maggie was right about you.\nScott Lang: How do you know about\u2026\u00a0?\nDr. Hank Pym: The way she\u2019s trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions.\nScott Lang: I don\u2019t understand.\nDr. Hank Pym: No, I don\u2019t expect you to. But you don\u2019t have many options right now. Quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?\nScott Lang: What?\n\n[flashback to Pym giving money to his housekeeper, Emily, so that she can tip Luis\u2019s friends to tip off about the job]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: Second chances don\u2019t come around all that much. So next time you think you might see one I suggest you take a real close look at it.\n[Pym rises and leaves the room]\nMaggie Lang: [referring to the ugly rabbit toy Scott gave her as Maggie is putting Cassie to sleep] Are you sure you don\u2019t want a different toy?\nMaggie Lang: Are you sure you don\u2019t want a different toy?\nCassie Lang: No, I love this one.\nMaggie Lang: Okay. Well, get some sleep then. I love you. [Maggie kisses Cassie on her head]\nCassie Lang: Mommy?\nMaggie Lang: Hm?\nCassie Lang: Is daddy a bad man? I heard some grownups say he\u2019s bad.\nMaggie Lang: No. Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?\n\n[as Scott is sat in his cell thinking several ants bring Scott the suit in its tiny form then enlarge it so that Scott can wear it, he quickly slip into it, zaps himself small to escape]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: Smart choice. You actually listened for once.\n[Scott runs out of the cell]\nDr. Hank Pym: Under the door.\n[as the prison alarm goes off Scott runs out of the building]\nScott Lang: Okay. Where to now?\nDr. Hank Pym: Hang tight.\n[some ants approach Scott]\nScott Lang: What? What?!\n\n[inside the police station]\n\nPaxton: Where the hell did he go?\nDetective: I have no idea, he just vanished. [into his radio] Set up a five block perimeter, now!\n[back to Scott; to the ants]\nScott Lang: Get back, get back, get back!\nDr. Hank Pym: Scott, these are my associates.\nScott Lang: Huh? You got a camera on an ant? Yeah, sure, why not? Where\u2019s the car?\nDr. Hank Pym: No car, we\u2019ve got wings. Incoming!\n[a large winged ant flies over Scott and lands in front of him]\nDr. Hank Pym: Put your foot on the central node and not the thorax.\nScott Lang: Are you ki\u2026\u00a0? How safe\u2019s this\u2026\u00a0?\nDr. Hank Pym: Get on the damn ant, Scott!\n[Scott gets on the ant and as it flies off the police go on a manhunt for him]\n[the winged ant has landed on a police car that\u2019s looking for Scott]\nScott Lang: Why am I on a police car? Shouldn\u2019t I not be on a police car?\nDr. Hank Pym: So they can give you a lift past their five block perimeter.\nScott Lang: Whoa. Alright. Now, what\u2019s the next move?\nDr. Hank Pym: Hang on tight.\nScott Lang: Oh, this is easy. I\u2019m getting the hang of this. Yank up to go up. It\u2019s like a horse.\nDr. Hank Pym: You\u2019re throwing 2-47 off balance.\nScott Lang: Wait, his name is 2-47?\nDr. Hank Pym: He doesn\u2019t have a name, he has a number Scott. Do you have any idea how many ants there are?\n[as the police car swerves]\nScott Lang: Whoa!\nDr. Hank Pym: Maybe it\u2019s 2-48.\n[as the ant flies up]\nScott Lang: No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!\nDr. Hank Pym: No, I think it\u2019s 2-47.\nScott Lang: Wait.\nDr. Hank Pym: Hang on.\nScott Lang: I think I\u2019m getting the hang of this.\n[as ant flies Scott around the city]\nDr. Hank Pym: I\u2019m controlling 2-47. He is not listening to you.\nScott Lang: What? Can I make one little request?\nDr. Hank Pym: No.\nScott Lang: Stop 2-47. Time out, time out. Time out. Alright, hold on. Just, wait. Whoa, uh! What happens if I throw up in this helmet?\nDr. Hank Pym: It\u2019s my helmet, Scott. Do not throw up.\nScott Lang: Just set her down, alright? I\u2019m getting light headed.\nDr. Hank Pym: Hang on, Scott.\nScott Lang: Yeah, I\u2019m getting a little light\u2026 it\u2019s funny\u2026 hit me, and\u2026\n[as the ant continues to fly Scott feels dizzy and falls off the ant\u2019s back]\n\n[Scott wakes up in a bedroom and jumps up in shock when he sees Hope watching over him]\n\nScott Lang: Hello. Who are you? Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time?\nHope van Dyne: Yes.\nScott Lang: Why?\nHope van Dyne: Because the last time you were here you stole something.\nScott Lang: Oh. Oh! Hey, look.\n[Scott goes to get out of bed but recoils when he sees insects crawling all over the floor]\nScott Lang: Whoa!\nHope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata. Giant tropical bullet ants. Ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index. They\u2019re here to keep an eye on you when I can\u2019t. Dr. Pym\u2019s waiting for you downstairs.\n[she turns and walks out of the room]\nScott Lang: Who? [calling out to Hope] Hey, um, whose pajamas are these? [gets no response] How am I supposed to do this?\n[Scott puts his foot down tentatively onto the floor and the ants make space for his foot]\nScott Lang: Right, just one step at a time.\n[he slowly stops towards the door as the ants make room for his feet]\nScott Lang: Ugh. You don\u2019t bite me, I don\u2019t step on you, deal?\n[in the dining hall]\nHope van Dyne: Take down the servers and Cross wouldn\u2019t even know it. We don\u2019t need this guy. [Scott enters the dining room where Pym and Hope are sat]\nDr. Hank Pym: I assume that you\u2019ve already met my daughter Hope.\nScott Lang: I did. She\u2019s great.\nDr. Hank Pym: She doesn\u2019t think that we need you.\nHope van Dyne: We don\u2019t. We can do this ourselves.\nDr. Hank Pym: I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope has you arrested.\nHope van Dyne: Okay, we can try this and when he fails I\u2019ll do it myself.\nDr. Hank Pym: She\u2019s a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job, which, judging by the fact that you\u2019re sitting opposite me, I take it that you\u2019re interested in.\nScott Lang: What job?\nDr. Hank Pym: Would you like some tea?\nScott Lang: Uh, sure. [Pym pours Scott some tea]\nDr. Hank Pym: I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system. Freezing that metal was particularly clever.\nScott Lang: Were you watching me?\nDr. Hank Pym: Scott, I\u2019ve been watching you for a while, ever since you robbed Vista Corp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp. [Scott see Hope smile to herself] Vista\u2019s security system is one of the most advanced in the business. It\u2019s supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it. Would you like some sugar?\nScott Lang: Yeah, thanks. [he sees two ants pushing two sugar cubes on the table towards his cup] You know what, I\u2019m okay. [referring to the ants] How do you make them do that?\nDr. Hank Pym: Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight. They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.\nScott Lang: Right. But how do you make them do that? [he sees the ants returning the sugar cubes into their bowl]\nDr. Hank Pym: I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center. I speak to them. I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything.\nHope van Dyne: And still know absolutely nothing. I\u2019m late to meet Cross. [Hope gets up and leaves] [Scott raises his hand to ask a question]\nScott Lang: Uh\u2026 Dr. Pym?\nDr. Hank Pym: You don\u2019t need to raise your hand, Scott.\nScott Lang: Sorry, I just have one question. Who are you? Who is she? What the hell\u2019s going on and can I go back to jail now?\nDr. Hank Pym: Come with me. [Pym takes Scott to his lab] Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.\nScott Lang: Huh?\nDr. Hank Pym: I learned how to change the distance between atoms, that\u2019s what powers the suit, that\u2019s why it works. [they enter Pym\u2019s lab]\nScott Lang: Whoa.\nDr. Hank Pym: But it was dangerous. It was too dangerous. So I hid it from the world. And that\u2019s when I switched gears and I started my own company.\nScott Lang: Pym Tech.\nDr. Hank Pym: Yes. I took on a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 called Darren Cross.\nScott Lang: Darren Cross. He\u2019s a big deal.\nDr. Hank Pym: But before he was a big deal he was my assistant. I thought I saw something in him, a son I never had perhaps. He was brilliant, but as we became close he began to suspect that I wasn\u2019t telling him everything. He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particles, and he became obsessed with recreating my formula. But I wouldn\u2019t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.\nScott Lang: How could he do that?\nDr. Hank Pym: The board\u2019s chairman is my daughter, Hope. She was the deciding vote. But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula. The process is highly volatile. What isn\u2019t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the brain\u2019s chemistry. I don\u2019t think Darren realizes this, and you know, he\u2019s not the most stable guy to begin with.\nScott Lang: So, what do you want from me?\nDr. Hank Pym: Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you?\nScott Lang: I do.\nDr. Hank Pym: If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now are you ready to redeem yourself?\nScott Lang: Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. What do you want me to do?\nDr. Hank Pym: I want you to break into a place and steal some shit. [Paxton receives a text from his partner, Gale, as he\u2019s sat having breakfast with Maggie and Cassie]\nMaggie Lang: You going to be home for dinner tonight? [Paxton reads the text, \u201cLang\u2019s \u201cLawyer\u201d is Dr. Hank Pym, as in Pym Tech]\nPaxton: Uh, yeah. I\u2019ll pick something up, text you.\nMaggie Lang: Okay. Good news? [Paxton gets up to leave]\nPaxton: Uh, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s news.\nCassie Lang: Are you trying to find my daddy?\nPaxton: Yeah, I am, sweetheart. I just want your daddy to be safe.\nCassie Lang: Hope you don\u2019t catch him. [Pym is showing Scott photos of the people he used to worked with]\nDr. Hank Pym: This isn\u2019t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry. That\u2019s Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at SHIELD, presently in the business of toppling governments. He always wanted my tech, and now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data, Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.\nScott Lang: I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.\nDr. Hank Pym: I\u2019ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark. I\u2019m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now. This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit. This could change the texture of reality. Besides they\u2019re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.\nScott Lang: Okay, then why don\u2019t you just send the ants?\nDr. Hank Pym: Scott, they are ants. Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader. Somebody that can infiltrate a place that\u2019s designed to prevent infiltration.\nScott Lang: Hank, I\u2019m a thief. Alright? I\u2019m a good thief. But this is insane. [just then Hope enters the lab]\nHope van Dyne: He\u2019s right Hank and you know it. You\u2019ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of. I was against using him when we had months, now we have days. I\u2019m wearing the suit.\nDr. Hank Pym: Absolutely not!\nHope van Dyne: I know the facility inside and out, I know how Cross thinks. I know this mission better than anybody here.\nDr. Hank Pym: We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work.\nHope van Dyne: We don\u2019t have time to screw around.\nDr. Hank Pym: Hope, please. Listen to me, please\u2026\nHope van Dyne: He is a criminal. I\u2019m your daughter.\nDr. Hank Pym: No! [Pym turns and sits down, Hope walks off in disappointment]\nScott Lang: She\u2019s right, Hank. I\u2019m not your guy. Why don\u2019t you wear the suit?\nDr. Hank Pym: You think I don\u2019t want to? I can\u2019t. I spent years wearing it. It took a toll on me. You\u2019re our only option. Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world. And now she looks at me and it\u2019s just disappointment. It\u2019s too late for me, but not for you. This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your daughter\u2019s eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are. It\u2019s not about saving our world, it\u2019s about saving theirs.\nScott Lang: Damn, that was a good speech.\n\nDr. Hank Pym: Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man.\n\n[we see Scott wearing the Ant-Man suit with Pym and Hope training him]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic. The suit has power, the man harnesses that power. You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast. You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime, so your size always suits your needs. [Hope closes the door] Now dive through the keyhole, Scott. You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big. [Scott puts on the helmet and charges for the keyhole]\nScott Lang: Ow! [we hear him fail several times as he continues to shrink and dive through the keyhole] Ah! Ow.\nHope van Dyne: [to Pym] Useless.\n\n[Hope trains Scott]\n\nHope van Dyne: When you\u2019re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide, you\u2019re like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone, too soft, it\u2019s a love-tap. In other words you have to know how to punch.\nScott Lang: I was in prison for three years, I know how to punch.\nHope van Dyne: Show me. [she puts up her hands and Scott hits her hand] Terrible.\nScott Lang: You want to show me how to punch? [he puts up his hand like hers] Show me\u2026 [suddenly Hope punches him in the face knocking him back]\nHope van Dyne: That\u2019s how you punch.\nDr. Hank Pym: She\u2019s been looking forward to this.\nScott Lang: No kiddin\u2019.\nDr. Hank Pym: Hope trained in martial arts at a, uh, difficult time.\nHope van Dyne: Oh, by difficult time, he means when my mother died.\nDr. Hank Pym: We lost her in a plane crash.\nHope van Dyne: It\u2019s bad enough you won\u2019t tell me how she died, could you please stop telling me that lie. We\u2019re working here. [as Scott is still recovering from her punch] Alright princess, let\u2019s get back to work.\nScott Lang: Were you going for the hand?\n\n[Pym finds Scott playing around with the suit\u2019s regulator]\n\nScott Lang: You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.\nDr. Hank Pym: Do not screw with the regulator. If that regulator is compromised you would go sub-atomic.\nScott Lang: What does that mean?\nDr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a quantum realm.\nScott Lang: What does *that* mean?\nDr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know, and love, gone forever.\nScott Lang: Cool. Yeah. I\u2019m\u2026 if it ain\u2019t broke.\n\n[return to training]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: You\u2019ve learned about the suit, but you\u2019ve yet to learn about your greatest allies: the ants. Loyal, brave, and your partners on this job.\n\n[Pym and Hope watch as Scott shrinks in their back garden and goes running under the earth]\n\nHope van Dyne: Paratrechina longicornis, commonly known as crazy ants, they\u2019re lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics. [Scott comes across a crazy ant]\nScott Lang: Oh, you\u2019re not so crazy. [the crazy ant jumps on him, knocking Scott back] Hey! You\u2019re cute. [suddenly a herd of crazy ants crawl all over Scott] Oh! Aaah! [Scott turns himself back to normal size and he pops up through the ground] That was a lot scarier a second ago.\n\n[as they look at Pym Technologies building map]\n\nScott Lang: It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply.\nHope van Dyne: There\u2019s a security guard posted around the clock, we\u2019ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.\n\n[shrunk again and back under the earth, Scott goes looking for more ants]\n\nScott Lang: Okay. Who\u2019s next? [a massive ant comes up behind Scott]\nHope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata.\nScott Lang: I know. Bullet ants, right? Number one on the Schmidt pain index. [to the ants] Hey, guys! Remember me from the bedroom? [as the ant goes to attack Scott pops back up the through the ground in his normal size] Whoa!\n\n[return to the Pym Technologies building map]\n\nHope van Dyne: The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter.\nScott Lang: Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?\nHope van Dyne: The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds.\nDr. Hank Pym: You\u2019re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers, retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.\n\n[return to training]\n\nHope van Dyne: [looking at another ant] Camponotus pennsylvanicus.\nDr. Hank Pym: Alternatively known as a carpenter ant. Ideal for ground and air transport.\nScott Lang: Wait a minute, I know this guy. I\u2019m going to call him Ant-thony.\nDr. Hank Pym: That\u2019s good. That\u2019s very good, because this time you\u2019re really going to have to learn how to control him. [we see the ants pushing sugar cubes on the table] Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.\n\n[we see Hope and Scott fight training, this time Scott lands a painful blow to Hope]\n\nScott Lang: Oh, you okay, d\u2026 [Hope suddenly punches Scott in the face and then knocks him down with her legs]\n\n[later as Scott is tending to his wound]\n\nHope van Dyne: Hank wants you outside for target practice.\nDr. Hank Pym: The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs. Red shrinks. Blue enlarges.\nHope van Dyne: [referring to another species of ant] Solenopsis mandibularis.\nDr. Hank Pym: Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects. They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.\n\n[back to Scott trying to get some ants to put the sugar cubes into the teacup]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: You can do it Scott, come on. [one of the ants flies off and Scott takes off his earpiece in frustration]\nScott Lang: They\u2019re not listening to me.\nHope van Dyne: You have to commit, you have to mean it. No shortcuts, no lies.\nDr. Hank Pym: Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.\nHope van Dyne: We don\u2019t have time for coddling.\nDr. Hank Pym: Our focus should be on helping Scott!\nHope van Dyne: Really? Is that where our focus should be? [Hope picks up the earpiece and uses it to instruct the ants to put the sugar cube into the teacup, then she gets a herd of ants to appear]\nDr. Hank Pym: Hope! [looking upset Hope walks over to Pym]\nHope van Dyne: I don\u2019t know why I came to you in the first place. [Hope leaves]\nDr. Hank Pym: We can\u2019t do this without her.\n\n[as Hope is about to leave in her car Scott gets in]\n\nHope van Dyne: Oh, God.\nScott Lang: You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really. There\u2019s some weird folks in this neighborhood.\nHope van Dyne: Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he\u2019s asking you to risk? You have a daughter.\nScott Lang: I\u2019m doing this for her.\nHope van Dyne: You know when my mother died I didn\u2019t see him for two weeks?\nScott Lang: He was in grief.\nHope van Dyne: Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back, not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that\u2019s at stake, just maybe we might have a chance at making peace. But even now he still wants to shut me out.\nScott Lang: He doesn\u2019t want to shut you out. He trusts you.\nHope van Dyne: Then why are you here?\nScott Lang: It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I\u2019m expendable, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. You must\u2019ve realized that by now. I mean, that\u2019s why I\u2019m in the suit and you\u2019re not. He\u2019d rather lose than fight than lose you. Anyway\u2026 [Scott goes to get out of the car]\nHope van Dyne: You know, I didn\u2019t know you had a\u2026 a daughter when I called the cops on you. What\u2019s her name?\nScott Lang: Cassie.\nHope van Dyne: It\u2019s a pretty name. You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise, that\u2019s how it works. Think about Cassie, about how badly you want to see her, and use that to focus. [she gives Scott the earpiece back to talk to the ants and places a coin on the dashboard] Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do. [couple of ants arrive and Scott gets them to pick up the coin] That\u2019s good. [they watch as Scott gets the ants to spin the coin]\n\n[Hope and Scott enter back into the house where Pym is waiting]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions. They called her the Wasp. She was born to it. And there\u2019s not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t regret having said yes. It was 1987, separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium.\n\n[in flashback we see Pym in his Ant-Man suit and his wife in her Wasp suit intercepted the missile]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile, but my regulator had sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn\u2019t hesitate.\n\n[we see Janet shrinking herself to stop the missile]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: Janet! No!\n\n[flash-forward]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: She turned off her regulator and went sub-atomic to deactivate the bomb. She was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.\nHope van Dyne: You were trying to bring her back.\nDr. Hank Pym: But all I learned was we know nothing.\nHope van Dyne: It\u2019s not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn\u2019t you tell me this sooner?\nDr. Hank Pym: I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn\u2019t mean to lose you too. [Hope begins to cry]\nHope van Dyne: I\u2019m sorry.\nScott Lang: This is awesome. It\u2019s awesome, you know? You guys are breaking down walls, you\u2019re healing. It\u2019s important. [Hope and Pym turn to look at him] I ruined the moment didn\u2019t I?\nDr. Hank Pym: Yes, you did, yes.\nScott Lang: I\u2019m gonna make some tea. [Scott turns and leaves]\n\n[we see Scott finally shrink down and dive through the keyhole]\n\nScott Lang: Nailed it!\n\n[he then goes under the earth, gets to fly on an ant]\n\nScott Lang: That\u2019s a good boy, Ant-thony.\n\n[we see him successfully work with the ants getting them to follow him]\n\nScott Lang: The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.\n\n[we see Scott in his shrunken form on the side of a plane]\n\nScott Lang: It\u2019s freezing! You couldn\u2019t make a suit with a flannel lining?\n\n[back in Pym\u2019s lab]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy, it\u2019s a device that I invented from my SHIELD days.\nHope van Dyne: We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.\nDr. Hank Pym: It\u2019s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark\u2019s old storage facilities in upstate New York. Should be a piece of cake.\n\n[back to plane]\n\nScott Lang: You\u2019re over the target area. Disengage, now, Scott.\n\n[back on the plane Scott instructs the ants]\n\nScott Lang: Squadron A, go. B, go. C, go. Alright, Ant-thony, please don\u2019t drop me this time. [they jump off the plane] Ah, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this.\nDr. Hank Pym: Stay calm.\nScott Lang: [approaching the \"old Stark warehouse\" he's supposed to burglarize] Uh, guys, we might have a problem. Hank, didn\u2019t you say this was some old warehouse? [The \"warehouse\" comes into clearer view, with a large circle-A insignia on the roof denoting its role as the Avengers' base] It\u2019s not! [we see that the warehouse is the new Avengers base] You son of a bitch!\nHope van Dyne: Scott, get out of there.\nDr. Hank Pym: Abort! Abort now.\nScott Lang: No, it\u2019s okay. It doesn\u2019t look like anyone\u2019s home. Ant-thony, get me to the roof.\nDr. Hank Pym: He\u2019s gonna lose the suit.\nHope van Dyne: He\u2019s gonna lose his life.\n\n[Scott lands in the roof of the new Avengers base]\n\nScott Lang: Alright I\u2019m on the roof of the target building.\nHope van Dyne: Somebody\u2019s home, Scott. [just then Sam Wilson in his Falcon flies in]\nVoice over Radio: [on Sam\u2019s radio] What\u2019s going on down there, Sam?\nScott Lang: It\u2019s the Falcon!\nSam Wilson: [into his radio] I had a sensor trip but I\u2019m not seeing anything. Wait a second.\nDr. Hank Pym: Abort, Scott! Abort now.\nScott Lang: It\u2019s okay, he can\u2019t see me.\nSam Wilson: I can see you.\nScott Lang: He can see me. [Scott enlarges himself back to normal size and waves to Falcon] Hi. I\u2019m Scott.\n\n[to Pym back in the lab as they listen to Scott]\n\nHope van Dyne: Did he just say \u201cHi I\u2019m Scott?\u201d\n\n[back to Avengers HQ]\n\nSam Wilson: What are you doing here?\nScott Lang: First off, I\u2019m a big fan.\nSam Wilson: Appreciate it. So who the hell are you?\nScott Lang: I\u2019m Ant-Man. [Sam smiles] Ant-Man?\nScott Lang: What, you haven\u2019t heard of me? No, you wouldn\u2019t have heard of me.\nSam Wilson: You want to tell me what you want?\nScott Lang: I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days, and then return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is.\nSam Wilson: I know exactly how that is. [into his radio] Located the breach. Bringing him in.\nScott Lang: Sorry about this! [just as Sam goes to grab Scott he shrinks himself, hits Sam and runs off]\nDr. Hank Pym: What the hell are you doing? [Sam chases after Scott]\nSam Wilson: Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech. [Sam flies in and lands to stamp on Scott but Scott manages to intercept it and fights off Sam]\nScot Lang: Sorry. Sorry about this. Sorry [Scott jumps around Sam while punching him]\nSam Wilson: That\u2019s enough! [Sam punches Scott as he jumps at him]\nScott Lang: Ant-thony, a little help. [Ant-thony flies in, Scott jump on his back and they fly into a vent and Sam goes to find him]\nDr. Hank Pym: I\u2019ve lost visual! [suddenly Sam bursts through one of the facility doors]\nSam Wilson: He\u2019s inside my pack.\nScott Lang: Sorry. You seem like a really great guy. [they fight but Scott gets manages to disable Sam\u2019s flight pack then flies off on Ant-thony; into his radio]\nSam Wilson: It\u2019s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.\n\n[back to Pym house]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: That was completely irresponsible and dangerous! You jeopardized everything! [Scott takes Pym\u2019s signal decoy out of his pocket and places it on the table]\nHope van Dyne: You got it. [Scott nods his head]\nDr. Hank Pym: Well done.\nScott Lang: Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me? He did, didn\u2019t he?\nHope van Dyne: Kind of sounded like he did.\nDr. Hank Pym: I was good, wasn\u2019t I?\nScott Lang: Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger, and didn\u2019t die?\nDr. Hank Pym: Now let\u2019s not dwell on the past. We gotta finish our planning. [Pym turns and leaves with the signal decoy]\nHope van Dyne: Don\u2019t mind him. You did good. [Pym enters his living room to find Cross standing there]\nDr. Hank Pym: Darren. How the hell did you get in here? [Pym closes the door]\nDarren Cross: You left the front door open, Hank. It\u2019s official. You\u2019re old. [Hope and Scott hear them from the kitchen]\nHope van Dyne: The plans! He will kill him. [back with Cross and Pym]\nDr. Hank Pym: Well to what do I owe this pleasure?\nDarren Cross: I have good news.\nDr. Hank Pym: Really? What\u2019s that?\nDarren Cross: Pym Tech, the company you created, is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world. We\u2019re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow alone. [Pym says nothing, at the same time Scott gets some ants to roll up their plans on the nearby table] You\u2019re welcome. I know this is odd, but I\u2019d like you to be there. This is my moment, I want you to see it.\nDr. Hank Pym: Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I\u2019ll be there.\nDarren Cross: What did you see in me?\nDr. Hank Pym: I don\u2019t know what you mean.\nDarren Cross: All those years ago, you picked me. What did you see?\nDr. Hank Pym: I saw myself.\nDarren Cross: Then why did you push me away?\nDr. Hank Pym: Because I saw too much of myself. [Cross turns and leaves] [after Cross leaves]\nHope van Dyne: He knows, he\u2019s baiting you! We have to call it off.\nDr. Hank Pym: We\u2019re all taking risks.\nHope van Dyne: What if he saw me here?\nDr. Hank Pym: He didn\u2019t. There\u2019s no way.\nHope van Dyne: How do you know that? [just then Hope gets a call from Cross] Darren, hi.\nDarren Cross: Hope, where are you right now?\nHope van Dyne: I\u2019m at home, why?\nDarren Cross: I just saw Hank. I still get nothing but contempt from him.\nHope van Dyne: Don\u2019t let him rile you up, he\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s just a senile old man.\nDarren Cross: We need to start everyone working around the clock, get the assembly line up and running. And I\u2019m tripling security. Full sensors at all entrances, and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.\nHope van Dyne: Great. Good idea.\nDarren Cross: Thank you, Hope. I\u2019m so lucky to have you on my team.\nHope van Dyne: He\u2019s tripling security, he\u2019s lost his mind, and he\u2019s on to you.\nDr. Hank Pym: But he is not on to you.\nHope van Dyne: He\u2019s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents. How are we gonna get Scott inside?\nScott Lang: The water main. You can\u2019t add security to a water main. The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that\u2019s how I get in.\nHope van Dyne: Somebody would have to reach the building\u2019s control center to change the water pressure. I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross, how are we supposed to do that?\nScott Lang: So we expand our team. What do we need? A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system, somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a getaway guy.\nDr. Hank Pym: No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.\n\n[Hope provides three cups of coffee for Luis, Dave and Kurt]\n\nLuis: Thank you for the coffee ma\u2019am. It\u2019s not too often that you rob a place, and then get welcomed back. Because we just robbed you!\nHope van Dyne: [to Scott] You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?\nLuis: Two smoothie machines.\nHope van Dyne: Are you sure they can handle this?\nLuis: Oh we can handle it, we\u2019re professionals.\nDr. Hank Pym: You\u2019ll forgive us if we\u2019re not instilled with confidence.\nDave: Wait, everybody. Just kick back and relax a little bit, man. we know our business. We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn\u2019t we?\nDr. Hank Pym: I let you.\nDave: Well, one could say that I let you let me.\nScott Lang: Look, it\u2019s okay. They can handle this.\nLuis: Yeah, we can handle it.\nScott Lang: You got their credentials?\nHope van Dyne: He\u2019s in the system.\nLuis: I\u2019m in the system?\nDave: The system.\nLuis: The system?\nDr. Hank Pym: Yeah. We\u2019re doomed.\nScott Lang: Alright, there\u2019s something you guys need to see.\n\n[a little while later, as Pym is showing Luis, Dave and Kur their plans Scott walks in wearing the Ant-Man suit]\n\nLuis: Damn! Whoa! That\u2019s so cool, bro!\nScott Lang: Now look, this is gonna get weird, alright? It\u2019s pretty freaky but it\u2019s safe. There\u2019s no reason to be scared.\nLuis: Aw, no, no. Daddy don\u2019t get scared.\nScott Lang: Really?\nLuis: Yeah.\nScott Lang: Good. [Scott shrinks himself freaking out Luis, Dave and Kurt]\nLuis: Oh!\nKurt: This is the work of the gypsies.\nDave: That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s witchcraft.\nLuis: Oh, that\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s like some David Copperfield shit.\nDave: That\u2019s some kind of wizardry.\nKurt: Sorcery!\nLuis: Ahh! Ahh! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! [runs out of the room] Get off! Get off! Ahh! [Luis runs off trying to get Scott off his shoulder]\nScott Lang: I thought daddy didn\u2019t get scared?\n\n[Luis, Dave and Kurt have all fallen asleep on the couch]\n\nHope van Dyne: I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them. Fell right asleep.\nScott Lang: Hey, look. I want to thank you for\u2026\nHope van Dyne: No, please don\u2019t. We\u2019re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us. I\u2019m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.\nScott Lang: Hey. Thank you, you know, for that pep talk.\nHope van Dyne: You know, the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to almost liking you.\nScott Lang: You really should write poetry. [Hope laughs]\nHope van Dyne: Get some sleep, Scott. [Hope leaves]\n\n[later that night Scott uses the Ant-Man suit to go and visit his daughter in her room as she sleeps]\n[outside Pym Technologies]\n\nScott Lang: Alright, just so we\u2019re clear, everyone here knows their role, right? Dave?\nDave: Wheels on the ground.\nScott Lang: Kurt?\nKurt: Eyes in the sky.\nScott Lang: Luis?\nLuis: Aw, man, you know it. You know what, I get to wear a uniform, that\u2019s what\u2019s up.\nScott Lang: Luis.\nLuis: I\u2019m sorry, I mean, I\u2019m good, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m just excited, and plus you\u2019re girlfriend\u2019s really hot, so you know that makes me nervous too. [to Hope] And you are very beautiful, ma\u2019am.\nDr. Hank Pym: Oh, my lord.\nScott Lang: She\u2019s not my\u2026\nLuis: Hey, you know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover, like a whistling, you know I\u2019m saying? To like, blend in.\nScott Lang: No, don\u2019t whistle. No whistling. It\u2019s not the Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.\n\n[on the night of the charity event, Luis makes it in employed as a security guard, outside Dave and Kurt are in their van with Scott in the back dressed in his suit]\n\nKurt: We\u2019re set.\nScott Lang: Wish me luck. [Scott gets out, shrinks himself as he goes through the water main]\nKurt: Utility is online.\n\n[inside the building Luis starts whistling]\n\nAlpha Guard: Hey. What are you doing?\nLuis: Uh, boss-man said to secure the area. So, I\u2019m securing.\nAlpha Guard: I\u2019m the boss.\nLuis: Oh.\nAlpha Guard: [into his radio] Utilities work room three\u2026 [Luis suddenly punches him, knocking him out unconscious and then lowers the water level]\nKurt: Water level is dropping.\n\n[Scott floats along on the water with the ants through the pipes]\n\nKurt: Coming up on extraction pipe.\nScott Lang: I see it! [to the ants] Alright, come on. I gotta get up there. That\u2019s it, that\u2019s it, guys, yeah! [the ants help him climb up to the extraction pipe] That\u2019s it, yeah. Yes! You got it! You got it, come on! [Scott makes it through one of the handwash sinks in the bathroom] Alright, let\u2019s fly Ant-thony. [Scott and the ants fly off]\nKurt: The Ant-Man is in the building.\n\n[as they see Pym pull up outside the building where the charity event is taking place]\n\nDave: Phshh. Got a Crown Vic right outside over there.\nKurt: This is problem?\nDave: Considering the Crown Vic\u2019s the most commonly used car for under-cover cops, man. Yes, this is a problem. [inside the Crown Vic is Paxton and Gale]\nPaxton: That\u2019s Pym. [they get out to go after Pym]\nKurt: Oh, no.\n\n[back with Scott and the ants]\n\nScott Lang: I\u2019m employing the bullet ants. Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna. I don\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called but I feel bad for this guy. [using the ants Scott takes down one of the security guards with Luis also punching him]\nLuis: See, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 bout. That\u2019s what I call it, an unfortunate casualty, in a very serious operation, you know? [Hope then comes along and enters the room and places the signal decoy]\nKurt: Signal decoy in place. Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.\nDave: Looks like Pym\u2019s getting arrested.\nKurt: Scott, we have problem.\nScott Lang: Problem? What\u2019s the problem? [just then Dave gets out of the can]\nKurt: Dave! Dave, that\u2019s not part of plan!\nDr. Hank Pym: [as Paxton and Gale are trying to arrest Pym] Listen to me, if I don\u2019t get into this building people will die.\nGale: That\u2019s awfully dramatic.\n\n[Dave creates a diversion by stealing Paxton and Gale\u2019s car]\n\nPaxton: Are you kidding me?! [they run after Dave as he drives off in their car]\nKurt: Problem solved.\n\n[inside the building Cross finds Hope]\n\nDarren Cross: Well. How do I look? [they then find Pym as he enters the building] There he is. Just in time. Come on. [Cross takes them to vault where he\u2019s keeping the Yellowjacket suit, and uses an eye scanner to open the door]\nComputer: Twelve point verification.\nDr. Hank Pym: Little over the top, don\u2019t you think, Darren?\nComputer: Confirming authorization.\nDarren Cross: No, you can never be too safe.\nComputer: Access granted. [they enter the vault]\nDr. Hank Pym: I gotta hand it to you, Darren, you really did it.\nDarren Cross: And you only know the half of it, Hank. [at the same time Carson arrives with his men]\n\n[back to Scott and the ants]\n\nScott Lang: Arriving at second position. Alright, top speed, Ant-thony! Let\u2019s go. [Scott and Ant-thony fly towards where the Yellowjacket suit is being kept] Proceeding to command position. [Scott jumps off Ant-thony] I\u2019ll be right back, Ant-thony. Alright, guys, I\u2019m in position. I\u2019m going to signal the ants. [Paxton and Gale find their car dumped can crashed into a tree]\nPaxton: No, no, no, no! [Dave gets back into the van with Kurt]\nDave: Did you see that? [he honks the musical horn which Paxton recognizes from Scott using it earlier]\n\n[back to Scott instructing the ants]\n\nScott Lang: Assume formation. Alright you cute little crazies, let\u2019s fry these servers. [the ants fry the servers and Scott jumps back onto Ant-thony] Let\u2019s go get \u2018em, buddy!\nKurt: Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased.\nScott Lang: Headed to the particle chamber.\n\n[Carson and his men enters the vault where Cross is with Pym and Hope]\n\nMitchell Carson: Hello, Dr. Cross. My associates agree to your terms.\nDarren Cross: Wonderful. [to Pym] They\u2019re not what they were, they\u2019re doing some interesting work. And I\u2019m enjoying myself. You tried to hide your technology from me, and now it\u2019s gonna blow up in your face. [suddenly Pym punches Cross in the face] Wow. Wow! I mean, I saw the punch coming a mile away but I just figured it\u2019d be all pathetic and weak.\nDr. Hank Pym: Well you figured wrong.\n\n[back outside Paxton and Gale walk over to Luis\u2019s van]\n\nPaxton: I know this van. [he bangs on the van door] Anybody home?\nDave: [to each other inside the van] Shh.\nKurt: Shh.\nDave: Shh!\nKurt: Shh!\nScott Lang: Alright, guys, I\u2019m here. Setting the charges. [Scott set the explosives; to the ants] Great job, guys. I\u2019ll take it from here. [Ant-thony sets Scott down] Good boy, Ant-thony. Final position. [to Kurt and Dave] Guys, how we lookin\u2019 on that laser grid?\nKurt: Almost!\nDave: No, you\u2019re not.\nKurt: I\u2019m getting close!\nDave: No, you\u2019re not. [Paxton keeps banging on Luis\u2019s van door]\nPaxton: San Francisco PD! Man in the van! I know you\u2019re in there! [inside the van as they wait for the laser grid to be disabled]\nDave: Make it go faster.\nKurt: Dude, seriously!\nScott Lang: Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?\nKurt: It\u2019s so close.\nPaxton: [suddenly the van door opens, Paxton and Gale point their guns at Kurt and Dave] Freeze!\nDave: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute! there was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.\nPaxton: Get out.\nDave: Take it easy!\nKurt: [Paxton pulls Kurt out of the van at the same time the laser grid is disabled; to Scott] Go! Go now! [Scott jumps to get to the Yellowjacket] Wait!\nScott Lang: What? What do you mean wait? [Kurt manages to struggle free from Paxton\u2019s hold to press a button on his computer to fully disable the lasers and just as Scott goes to grab the suit it\u2019s pulled away] What? What? [Cross sees Scott and taps on the glass]\nDarren Cross: Hi, little guy. [to Pym] I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere, which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man? Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me? [pauses a moment] Scott Lang. The martyr, who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only daughter in the process. Exactly your kind of guy, Hank. He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how, and then, he disappears magically, despite having no money to his name, and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit, the only thing that can rival my creation.\nDr. Hank Pym: Darren, don\u2019t do this. If you sell to these men, it\u2019s going to be chaos.\nDarren Cross: I already have, and for twice the price, thanks to you. It\u2019s not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility. Thankfully, word travels fast. Oh, I\u2019ll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I\u2019m keeping the particle to myself. They don\u2019t run on diesel. If you want the fuel you\u2019ll have to come to me. What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?\nDr. Hank Pym: The most powerful man in the world.\nDarren Cross: You proud of me yet?\nDr. Hank Pym: You can stop this, Darren. It\u2019s not too late.\nDarren Cross: It\u2019s been too late for a long time now. [one of the men in the chamber points their gun at Pym]\nHope van Dyne: Darren, what are you doing?\nDarren Cross: He wasn\u2019t any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.\nHope van Dyne: This is not who you are, it\u2019s the particles altering your brain chemistry.\nDarren Cross: [to the guy pointing a gun at Pym] Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You\u2019re right, I have to be the one to do it. [he points a gun at Pym\u2019s head, at the same time Hope takes out her weapon and points it at Cross]\nMitchell Carson: Here we go.\nHope van Dyne: Drop your gun.\nDarren Cross: You know I came to the house the other night to kill him, but you were there.\nHope van Dyne: You\u2019re sick and I can help you just put the gun down.\nDarren Cross: I wasn\u2019t ready to kill you then, but I think I am now!\nHope van Dyne: Drop your gun, now!\nDarren Cross: You picked the wrong side, Hope. [just then Scott breaks out using the disc Pym gave him that turn things large, he starts fighting off the men in the chamber and Pym is shot in the chaos]\nHope van Dyne: Dad! [grabbing hold of the wounded Pym]\nScott Lang: Hank. No, no. Hank. Hank. Listen, you\u2019re gonna be okay. Alright? You\u2019re gonna be just fine. [Cross comes up behind Scott and points his gun at the back of Scott\u2019s head]\nDarren Cross: Take the suit off or I\u2019ll blow your brains out and peel it off! [Scott instructs the ants to disable Cross\u2019 gun and bite him, so he takes off and the same time Carson takes off with vial of Cross\u2019 particles]\nPaxton: [Luis sets off the alarm to the building; into his radio] We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech, request immediate backup.\nDave: [Paxton and Gale head off; to Kurt] Go, go, go! [Dave and Kurt get into the van and drive off]\nHope van Dyne: [inside the vault] Dad, can you move?\nDr. Hank Pym: Yes.\nScott Lang: We need to get him out of here.\nHope van Dyne: Go get that suit. [Scott takes off and tries to get away from the two guards shooting at him]\n\n[Scott shrinks himself into the small building model of Cross of Tech to get away from the guards shooting at him, then Luis comes to the rescue and knocks out the guards]\n\nLuis: Hey, Scotty. Hey, did I save your life? Scotty? Scotty? [Scott makes himself large again]\nScott Lang: Thank you, Luis.\nLuis: Hey, are we the good guys?\nScott Lang: Yeah.\nLuis: We\u2019re the good guys, right?\nScott Lang: Yeah, we\u2019re the good guys.\nLuis: Feels kind of weird, you know?\nScott Lang: Yeah, but we\u2019re not done yet. Get out of here before this place blows. [Scott shrinks himself and takes off]\nLuis: [as Luis tries to leave the building he remembers the guard he knocked out earlier] Oh, dammit! That guy. [he opens the door and rushes to the guard who is tied up] Hey! We\u2019re getting out of here! [back inside the vault Hope helps Pym sit up]\nHope van Dyne: The charges are set. We\u2019ve got to find a way out of here and fast.\nDr. Hank Pym: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not gonna die, and neither are you. [he holds up a keychain that looks like a tank] It\u2019s not a keychain.\n\n[outside]\n\nPaxton: [into his radio] All the chaos in here! Multiple shots fired. [suddenly a tank bursts out through the building] And there\u2019s a tank. [Luis then walks out of the building with the guard]\nLuis: A little help. [someone takes hold of the guard, at the same time Hope helps Pym out of the tank] I got him. [Luis helps Pym]\nHope van Dyne: We need a doctor! [a medic comes over to help Pym]\n\n[Cross is in his helicopter]\n\nDarren Cross: Let\u2019s go! [just as they are about to leave Cross sees a swarm of flung ants heading towards him with Scott on Ant-thony, Cross takes out a gun and starts shooting and one of the bullets hits Ant-thony]\nScott Lang: Ant-thony! [Scott falls onto another ant]\nDarren Cross: Go! [the helicopter door is closed]\nScott Lang: You\u2019re gonna regret that. [Cross\u2019 helicopter takes off] [Paxton sees Luis as he gets into his van]\nPaxton: Wait a minute! Get out of that van!\nLuis: What?\nPaxton: Get out of that van!\nLuis: It\u2019s too loud there\u2019s a tank, I can\u2019t hear you! [he closes the van door and Dave drives off]\nPaxton: Hey! Hey! [Scott makes it into Cross\u2019 helicopter and Cross starts shooting at him]\nDarren Cross: Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?\nScott Lang: It was never just a heist! [Scott sets off charges set around Pym Technologies and Cross watches in shock as the whole building is destroyed] Put the gun down!\n\n[Cross hits Scott and he falls out of the helicopter window back into his normal size] \n[Scott manages to get back into the helicopter but finds Cross wearing the Yellowjacket, they both shrink start fighting and fall into a briefcase which falls out of the helicopter]\n\nDarren Cross: I\u2019m gonna disintegrate you! [inside the briefcase they accidentally hit the cell phone]\nCell Phone: Playing \u201cDisintegration\u201d by The Cure. [\u201cDisintegration\u201d by The Cure starts playing as Scott and Cross continue to fight]]\n\n[[Briefcase falls into a family\u2019s pool, Scott and Cross blast out in a splash as they return to normal size]\n\nPool BBQ Dad: Call 911! [Scott and Cross continue to fight shrinking and growing until Scott swats Cross into a bug zapper]\nScott Lang: It\u2019s okay. [the family runs off in fear]\n\n[Paxton and Gale show up]\n\nGale: Police! Put your hands up!\nPaxton: Get \u2018em up! [Scott pulls up his helmet] Scott?\nScott Lang: Paxton, you have to listen to me- [as Scott goes to walk towards Paxton they taser him and falls down unconscious]\n\n[as Paxton and Gale are driving Scott back to the police station Scott wakes up] Paxton, turn around, take me back.\n\nPaxton: I\u2019m taking you back, to prison.\nScott Lang: There\u2019s something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed. In the bug zapper, it\u2026\nPaxton: [Paxton suddenly stops the car and turns to Scott] You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand!\nPolice Radio: All units we have a 236 in progress at 840 Winter Street.\nScott Lang: It\u2019s Cassie! [Paxton takes off towards his house]\n\n[Cross is standing in Cassie\u2019s room looking menacing]\n\nDarren Cross: Don\u2019t be scared. [Paxton pulls up outside his house]\nPaxton: Maggie, what\u2019s going on?\nMaggie Lang: He\u2019s got Cassie!\nPaxton: Who\u2019s got Cassie?\nMaggie Lang: That thing, that thing! I don\u2019t know what it\u2026\u00a0! [back in Paxton\u2019s car, Scott manages to put on his helmet, shrinks and takes off]\n\n[Cross starts walking towards Cassie]\n\nCassie Lang: Are you a monster?\nDarren Cross: Do I look like a monster?\nCassie Lang: I want my daddy!\nDarren Cross: I want your daddy too. [he picks up Cassie and she screams, just then Scott shows up] There you are.\nCassie Lang: Daddy, is that you? [Scott pulls up his helmet]\nScott Lang: Hi, Peanut. [to Cross] Why don\u2019t you pick on someone your own size? [he throws a disc at Cross which shrinks him then he shrinks himself, Cross is now on the Thomas The Tank Engine toy in Cassie\u2019s room]\nDarren Cross: Now where did you go, little guy? [he spots Scott running towards him] There you are. [he starts firing lasers from his suit at Scott]\nScott Lang: Not just me. [a swarm of ants follow behind Scott] Get him! Go! Go! [Cross fights off the ants as they attack him, then Scott and Cross fight across the Thomas The Tank Engine toy]\nLuis: [as they drive towards Paxton\u2019s house] Scotty needs us, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? Ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 gonna stop us. [they stop as they see a load of police cars and cops surrounding the house] Back it up. Back it up slow.\nDave: Yeah. [Dave starts to slowly back the van away]\nLuis: Just back it up.\nDave: Yep, yep.\nLuis: Back it up.\nDave: Okay.\nLuis: All we gonna do is, we ju\u2026 we just back it up.\nDave: Okay. That\u2019s it.\nLuis: Back it up.\nDave: That\u2019s right.\nLuis: Back it up.\nDave: Yep.\nLuis: Okay, now-now-now. Just back it up.\nDarren Cross: [as they continue to fight in Cassie\u2019s room inside the Thomas The Tank Engine railway] You insult me, Scott. Your very existence is insulting to me. [Cross shoots his laser at Scott as he runs around Cassie\u2019s room] You know it would be much easier to hit you if you were bigger!\nScott Lang: Yeah, I agree. [Scott throws two discs at Cross, he deflects it one hitting an ant the other the Thomas The Tank Engine toy and they both grow large]\nPaxton: Cassie! [Paxton runs into the house]\nDarren Cross: I\u2019m gonna show you just how insignificant you are. [Paxton goes to run up the stairs]\nPaxton: Cassie, I\u2019m coming! [suddenly the large ant heads his way, he falls down the stairs as the giant ant breaks out of the house]\nGale: That\u2019s a messed-up looking dog.\nDarren Cross: [back inside Cassie\u2019s room; to Scott] I\u2019m going to destroy everything you love! [Paxton shows up]\nPaxton: Freeze! S.F.P.D.! [Cross throws Paxton\u2019s gun aside, at the same time Scott climbs up the back of Cross\u2019 suit]\nScott Lang: I can\u2019t break through!\nDarren Cross: It\u2019s titanium, you idiot!\nScott Lang: [to Paxton as Scott and Paxton continue fighting] Get her out of here! [Paxton carries Cassie off]\nPaxton: Come on.\nDarren Cross: [as Paxton goes to leave the room with Cassie in his arms Cross stops them] Sorry, sweetheart. You have to help daddy pay for his mistakes.\nPaxton: You stay behind me, okay?\nCassie Lang: Okay.\nPaxton: Behind me. [Scott looks up at Cross\u2019 particle pack]\nScott Lang: I\u2019m gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there. [to Cross] Get away from us! Daddy, help! [Scott jumps up to head towards Cross\u2019 particle pack] I love you, Cassie. [Scott shrinks to a small enough size to break into Cross\u2019 particle pack, this causes Cross and Scott to go subatomic and disappear]\nCassie Lang: Daddy, where are you? [Scott floats past dust, viruses, molecules, atoms, hadrons, quarks, and finally the deepest parts of gluons and remembers Pym\u2019s words]\nDr. Hank Pym: [voice] Go sub-atomic\u2026 go sub-atomic\u2026 [Scott tries to grow himself back to normal size but realized he can\u2019t]\nScott Lang: Oh, no. [he continues to float in the quantum realm]\nDr. Hank Pym: [voice] You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant. And as you shrink for all eternity, everything that you know and love gone forever. [Scott hears Cassie\u2019s voice echoing as he floats in the quantum realm]\nCassie Lang: [voice] Daddy! Where are you? Daddy!\nScott Lang: Cassie.\nCassie Lang: [voice] Come on, daddy. [Scott remembers the discs Pym had given him and takes one out]\nDr. Hank Pym: [voice] Do not mess with the regulator. [Scott places the disc in the regulator, presses the button and finally returns to normal size] I love you so much.\nScott Lang: I love you too, so much.\nPaxton: [as Scott is holding onto Cassie Paxton mildly gets Scott\u2019s attention] There\u2019s a big hole in the roof.\nScott Lang: Sorry. [Gale runs up to Cassie\u2019s room and we see Paxton holding Cassie and Scott has gone]\nGale: Is she alright?\nPaxton: She\u2019s fine. [Maggie enters the room]\nCassie Lang: Mommy. [Maggie grabs hold of Cassie with relief]\nPaxton: She\u2019s fine, she\u2019s fine. [Cassie notices Scott in his shrunken size wave goodbye to her and leaves]\n\n[the next day Scott is over at Pym\u2019s house]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: Scott, please. You don\u2019t remember anything?\nScott Lang: Hank, I\u2026 I don\u2019t.\nDr. Hank Pym: There must be something else. Well I suppose the human mind just can\u2019t comprehend the experience, but you made it. You went in and you got out, that\u2019s amazing.\nHope van Dyne: Scott, I\u2019ll walk you out.\nScott Lang: [to Pym] Get some rest. [Scott and Hope leave the room, Pym looks over to the photo of himself with his wife holding Hope when she was a baby]\nDr. Hank Pym: Is it possible? [Pym gets up to leave his room, as he opens the door he finds Hope and Scott kissing] When did this happen?\nHope van Dyne: Nothing\u2019s happening.\nScott Lang: Whoa, hold on. Something\u2019s kind of happening.\nDr. Hank Pym: Well if that\u2019s the case\u2026 shoot me again.\nScott Lang: [looking at Hope] Yeah, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing grabbing me and kissing me like that. I was a little surprised myself. I have to get somewhere. I\u2019ll see you later, Hank. Really, Hope. [Scott turns to leave]\nDr. Hank Pym: Scott.\nScott Lang: Yeah?\nDr. Hank Pym: You\u2019re full of shit.\nScott Lang: Oh, yeah.\n\n[Scott is having dinner with Paxton, Maggie, and Cassie]\n\nPaxton: Well, Scott I met with my Captain today, he wanted a report of the night that you got out of jail. Something happened with the cameras, circuits got fried, and\u2026 But I told him you were processed correctly.\nScott Lang: Really?\nPaxton: Well, yeah. Can\u2019t be sending Cassie\u2019s dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?\nScott Lang: Thank you, Paxton. I\u2019m blown away. Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.\nPaxton: Oh, well, that\u2019s my pleasure. But no, no, this one, I\u2026 I did it for you.\nScott Lang: This is awkward.\nPaxton: Yeah.\nCassie Lang: Yeah.\nScott Lang: I mean what do we even talk about after all of that?\nCassie Lang: Oh, I know.\nScott Lang: What?\nCassie Lang: I did my first cartwheel today.\nScott Lang: What?\nMaggie Lang: Yeah. She has been practicing all week, but today was the magic day.\nPaxton: I recorded it on my phone here. [Paxton shows Scott his recording of Cassie doing her first cartwheel]\nScott Lang: No, that can\u2019t be Cassie. That\u2019s not you.\nMaggie Lang: Yeah, it is.\nCassie Lang: Yeah it is.\nScott Lang: This is a professional gymnast, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s you.\nPaxton: Yeah, that\u2019s her. [Cassie feeds the giant ant hiding under the table that had escaped during Scott and Cross\u2019 fight]\nCassie Lang: Good, boy. [after watching the video of Cassie doing her cartwheel]\nScott Lang: Sweetie, that\u2019s pretty amazing, Peanut. [just then Scott gets a call] Sorry. It\u2019s work. [he answers the call] Yeah?\n\n[Scott meets up with Luis, Dave and Kurt]\n\nScott Lang: Alright, here\u2019s the deal. Just give me the facts.\nLuis: Just the facts, only the facts.\nScott Lang: Breathe, focus, keep it simple.\nLuis: No, no, no, no doubt, no doubt. Okay, so I\u2019m at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right? And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit, but you know me, I\u2019m more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right? But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro. Oh, my God\u2026\nScott Lang: Luis.\nLuis: Okay. Sorry, sorry. I\u2019m ju\u2026 you know, uh, I just get excited and stuff. But anyway, anyway. When Ignacio tells me: \u201cYoh, I met this crazy fine writer chick at this spot last night. Like, fine, fine, crazy stupid fine.\u201d And he goes up to the bartender and goes: \u201cLook at the girl I\u2019m with? You know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? She\u2019s crazy stupid fine, right?\u201d [we see flashback to Ignacio meeting the girl and talking to the bartender who is in fact Stan Lee] And the bartender\u2019s all like: \u201cYeah, crazy stupid fine.\u201d So this writer chick tells Ignacio: \u201cYoh, I\u2019m like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism, and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains. You know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\u201d Ignacio\u2019s like: \u201cFor real? And she\u2019s like: Yeah. You know what, I can\u2019t tell you who my contact is, because he works with the Avengers.\u201d\nScott Lang: Oh, no.\nLuis: Yeah, and this dude sounds like a bad-ass, man. Like he comes up to her and says\u2026 [we see flashback of the girl meting up with Sam Wilson in a park] \u201cYoh, I\u2019m looking for this dude who\u2019s no one seen, who\u2019s flashing this fresh tack, who\u2019s got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got? She\u2019s like: \u201cWell, we got everything nowadays, we got a guy who jumps, we got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls. You gotta be more specific.\u201d And he\u2019s like: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a guy who shrinks.\u201d And I\u2019m like: \u201cDamn!\u201d [to Scott] I got all nervous cause I keep mad secrets for you, bro. So I asked Ignacio: \u201cDid bad-ass tell the stupid fine writer chick to tell you to tell me because I\u2019m tight with that man, that he\u2019s looking for him?\u201d\nScott Lang: And? What\u2019d he say?\nLuis: He said yes.\n\n[mid-credit scene; Hank brings Hope down to his lab]\n\nDr. Hank Pym: There\u2019s something I want to show you. I realized you can\u2019t destroy power, all you can do is to make sure that it\u2019s in the right hands. [he opens up a vault to reveal the prototype of the Wasp suit] This is an advanced prototype that your mother and I worked on together. She never got to use it, but now I realize that we were\u2026 we were working on it for you. [Hope looks at the suit in shock then back to Pym] Maybe it\u2019s time we finished it. [Hope looks back at the suit and smiles]\nHope van Dyne: It\u2019s about damn time.\n\n\n[post-credits scene: Sam and Steve Rogers are in a garage with the Winter Soldier, his metal arm tightly clamped in a vise and a forlorn look on his face]\n\nSam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve and Sam are in an underground room with they are holding Bucky Barnes with his metal arm trapped in a vice] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.\nSteve Rogers: If we call Tony\u2026\nSam Wilson: He won\u2019t believe us.\nSteve Rogers: Even if he did\u2026\nSam Wilson: Who knows if the accords will let him help?\nSteve Rogers: We\u2019re on our own.\nSam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.\n\n[the final screen text shows \u201cANT-MAN WILL RETURN\u201d]\n[End of Ant-Man]\n\n\n\n"

There, Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym are talking to a woman.]\nJanet:\u00a0[to the woman, faintly]\u00a0Hopefully, it's not for long, but I'll call you when we get settled.When I have a better indication of what's going on.\nYoung Hope: Mommy?\n[Janet and Hank turn around to face their daughter. Janet sighs as Hank gets the bags situated.]\nJanet: Oh, Jellybean. [She kneels down to meet eye-level with Hope.]\u00a0Daddy and I have a last minute business trip, so Rose is going to stay with you for a few days.\nYoung Hope: No. I don't want you to go.\nJanet:\u00a0Ugh! It's gonna be so boring! I won't be able to keep my... eyes...\n[Janet then pretends to have dozed off. Hope giggles as Janet snores. Hank walks up to his daughter.\nHank:\u00a0Goodbye, sweetheart. Alright, we'll see you soon.\u00a0[He kisses Hope on the forehead. He then touches Janet's shoulder.]\n[Janet snorts \"awake.\" Both girls giggle.]\u00a0\nHank:\u00a0[voiceover]\u00a0I wish we could have put down our bags, and tucked you back into your bed, but too many lives were at stake.\u00a0\n[Cut to a shrunken\u00a0Janet and Hank flying onto a metal surface, leaves flying through the air.]\nHank:\u00a0Oh my god! They've already launched!\n[A missile flies up from the surface.]\nJanet:\u00a0We have to stop it! Come on!\n[Hank grapples himself up on the bomb while Janet flies. As the missile rockets through the air, Hank and Janet hang onto the steel, desperately trying to disarm the missile.]\nHank:\u00a0[voiceover]\u00a0The only way to disarm the missile was to get inside it, but the plating was too thick. The only way in was to shrink between the molecules.\u00a0\n[Janet flies up beside Hank, putting a grapple line onto her waist.]\nJanet:\u00a0I can't get through! Hank...\n[A landmass comes to view through the clouds, meaning the missile could wipe out that place any second.]\nHank:\u00a0[voiceover]\u00a0We both knew that if you go that small, there's no coming back.\u00a0\n[Hank tries to turn a button on his belt, but it sparks and fails. Janet watches.]\nHank:\u00a0[voiceover]\u00a0It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged. Your mother's wasn't.\n[Janet flies up into the air and turns a button on her belt, making the red light flash.]\u00a0\nJanet:\u00a0Tell Hope I love her...\nHank: [voiceover] She turned it off.\nHank:\u00a0Janet, no! \u00a0\n[Janet flies into the missile, and shrinks until she cannot be seen. She flies through various systems, disarming the machine and making sparks fly everywhere.]\nHank:\u00a0[voiceover}\u00a0And went subatomic to deactivate the bomb.\u00a0\n[The rocket tumbles and splashes into the ocean.]\nHank:\u00a0[voiceover]\u00a0Your mother saves thousands of lives that day, knowing she'd be lost in the quantum realm. Alone. Afraid.\u00a0Gone forever.\n[Young Hope looks back at the doorway and disrupts her playing to greet her father at the door, who looks tired and traumatized. Hope's lip quivers, and Hank pulls her in for an embrace.]\nHank: [voiceover] Telling you that she wasn't coming home, was the hardest thing that I ever had to do.\n[Cut to present day, with a grown Hope and an older Hank.]\u00a0But then Scott showed up...or should I say, broke into our house. And when he went to the Quantum Realm... he came back, everything changed. I started to wonder...could your mother still be alive? [Hank stands up, and Hope follows.]\u00a0So I dusted off some old plans.\n[Hank pulls a rubber band off a rolled up white piece of paper and unfolds it on the huge table. The plans are a blueprint for a \"quantum tunnel.\"]\nHope: Dad, what are you saying?\nHank: I think it's possible to bring her back.\n[Present Day]\nScott: Okay. We're in.\u00a0[A flashlight clicks and turns on, illuminating Scott's face. He shines the light around.]\u00a0Aw, this place is a maze. Where's that map? ['Scott grabs the map and shines the flashlight on it]\u00a0We're definitely close. [Scott lowers the map to reveal his ten year old daughter, Cassie, is with him.]\u00a0Are you ready?\nCassie: I'm ready, Daddy.\nScott: Are you\u00a0sure? Cause once we're inside, you show any hesitation or\u00a0fear, we're done.\nCassie: I eat fear for breakfast.\nScott: Wow. That is super cool. Come on.\n[Scott and Cassie crawl through the cardboard maze; a fake ant face shows up]\nScott: Look! It's Anton.\u00a0He'll show us the way. Anton, which way do we go?\u00a0[There's silence. Scott sighs.] (louder)\u00a0Anton, which way do we go?!\n[Startled, Luis quickly gets up and runs toward the cardboard maze; he grabs two strings and pulls, making the ant's limbs\u00a0point right.]\nScott: Thanks Anton!\n[Luis runs back to his computer; Scott and Cassie continue through the maze]\nScott Lang: Look! The\u00a0ants have burrowed into the tech facility.\nCassie Lang: Oh, no! Lasers!\n[Pieces of red string\u00a0appear with a red glow, making them look like real lasers. Cassie wiggles through the \"lasers\" with ease; Scott gets tangled by one]\nScott Lang:\u00a0Oh! I think I\u00a0got lased!\n[The duo\u00a0make their way through the lasers; A green, glowing \"eye scanner\" appears]\nScott Lang: The secret vault. Tell me you brought the contact lens.\nCassie Lang: Yup!\u00a0\n[Cassie puts a huge paper plate with an eye drawn on it over her face.]\nScott Lang: Perfect! Right there.\n[Scott pulls a lever; the glowing disc dings. Cassie takes the lens off her face; the cardboard doors open]\nCassie Lang:\u00a0There! It's the microtreasure!\n[A\u00a0small trophy is on a plate.]\nScott Lang: My trophy?\nCassie Lang: It looks like treasure.\nScott Lang: Oh, it is to me.\nCassie Lang: I wanna take it to show and tell.\nScott Lang: Oh, you can't do that. Can't. It never leaves the house. It's too important. This is the best birthday present you ever got me. I'm so touched you think I'm the 'World's Greatest Grandma.'\"\n[The camera cuts to the trophy plaque, which indeed says\u00a0'World's Greatest Grandma.']\nCassie: (giggles) It was the only one they had.\nScott:\u00a0Makes me wanna knit you a sweater.\u00a0\n[Luis lifts up the sheet covering the maze, laptop in hand, so he can face Scott.]\nCassie:\u00a0Oh no! The fuzz!\u00a0\nLuis:\u00a0Hey, Scotty. I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings, and I think we have way too many security cameras, don't we?\nScott:\u00a0No, no, not at all.\nLuis:\u00a0You sure? 'Cause it's a lot of security cameras.\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0I know what he needs. Who's the security expert in our business?\u00a0\nLuis:\u00a0You are, but I'm running the company, and if we oversell it, he's gonna\u00a0go somewhere else. I mean, we gotta land this bird.\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0He ain't goin' anywhere. And the expression is \"'land this fish.\"\nLuis:\u00a0No. It's \"land the bird.\" Just like you land a plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business.\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things, but I do.\nLuis:\u00a0How am I gonna land a fish? It can't walk. And if it swam up on a shore, and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?\nScott:\u00a0You really turned me around on this thing. It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan. Now, if you just excuse me, I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter.\u00a0\nLuis:\u00a0Imma go recheck it.\n[Scott pulls a string, making an alarm clock ring.]\nCassie:\u00a0To the escape ant.\u00a0\n[A cardboard door lifts open.]\nCassie:\u00a0Let's bounce before the po-po come back.\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0The po-po? How do you even know that?\u00a0[Scott and Cassie get on a paper-mache ant.]\u00a0Let's fly Antionette. Let's fly!\n[Scott pushes a stick holding the ant in place, causing it to slide down the stairs. Scott and Cassie scream and whoop as the ant slides through a cardboard slide down the stairs, through the hallway, and eventually down the porch steps into the backyard.]\nScott:\u00a0Crash landing!\u00a0\n[Sure enough, the ant crashes into the fence. Scott and Cassie tumble into the ground in laughter. Cassie props herself up on her elbow.]\nCassie:\u00a0I wish we could shrink for real.\nScott:\u00a0Oh, that is pretty cool!\n[Luis sticks his head out the top window, calling out to Scott.]\nLuis:\u00a0Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty. And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know. But I feel like I'm way better. My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff, and my hands are shaking, but I think that's unrelated, you know?\nScott:\u00a0It's gonna be great, Luis. You got nothing to worry about.\u00a0\nLuis:\u00a0Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss, I'm the boss, I'm the boss...\u00a0[Luis shrinks back into the house, almost trying to convince himself that it's going to be fine.]\n[There's a shrill beeping.]\nCassie: [points]\u00a0Daddy!\n[The camera shows a black attachment outside the house beeping and blinking a red light. Scott looks at it in fear, then looks at his left foot, which is through the hole in the fence. Scott groans.]\n[Cut to FBI agents looking through Scott's house. Agent Woo looks through the house, Scott and Cassie following him.]\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0Come on, Woo! I got three days left. Why would I try to escape?\u00a0\nWoo: I'm sorry, Scott, but rules are rules. You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place. Keel to stern. Soup to nuts.\u00a0\n[A woman accidentally bumps the lampstand, sending a glass object to the ground. Scott looks as it shatters.]\nScott: ['sarcastically to the woman]\u00a0Thank you. [to Woo]\u00a0It was an accident. My foot went through the fence.\u00a0\nCassie:\u00a0Our flying ant crashed.\n[Woo looks at Scott in confusion and concern.]\nScott:\u00a0Hey, you try entertaining a ten-year-old when you can't leave the house. You know the lengths that I've gone to? [Scott holds up his hand, and flicks it, making an Ace of Spades card appear in his hand out of thin air.] Close up magic. [He flicks the card away before putting his hand behind Cassie's ear and making another Ace of Spades return to his hand. He tosses it behind again.]\u00a0I learned that.\u00a0\nCassie: Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?\n[Woo looks to Scott in amusement before kneeling down to face Cassie at eye-level.]\nWoo:\u00a0Oh, Cassie.\u00a0This must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh? Well, think of it this way: Your school has rules, right? Like...You can't draw on the walls. Well, your Daddy went to Germany anddrew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph 3 of the Sokovia Accords.[Woo is now rambling, seeming to forget a child is front of him.]\u00a0Now as a part of his joint plea deal with Homeland Security and the German government, he's allowed to return to the U.S., provided he serve two years under house arrest, followed by three years of probation. and avoid any unauthorized activities, technology, or contact with any former associates, who were or currently are, in violation of said Accords, or any related statutes.\u00a0[Woo looks satisfied with his answer. Cassie, however, has her eyes wide, trying to process all of the things he said.]\u00a0Okay sweetie?\nScott:\u00a0(sarcastically) Wow, you're really great with kids.\nWoo:\u00a0Thanks, I'm also a youth pastor.\u00a0[Scott's face snaps from a smile to confusion.]\u00a0Anyway, not to be a Johnny Ask-A-Lot, but you haven't had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope van Dyne, have you?\nScott:\u00a0No.\u00a0\nWoo:\u00a0You sure? Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. And associating with them breaks your deal. And I don't need to remind you that any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum.\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.\nCassie:\u00a0They hate his guts.\nScott:\u00a0Thanks, peanut.\u00a0\n[Woo looks around before leaning towards Scott and lowering his voice.]\nWoo:\u00a0How'd you do it, Scott?\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0Do what?\nWoo:\u00a0(slightly ashamed)\u00a0The card trick.\nScott:\u00a0(in slight disbelief)\u00a0Seriously?\n[Cut to Maggie, Scott's divorced wife, and Paxton, her current fiancee, walking up the steps to the house.]\nMaggie:\u00a0Oh my god! You people can't just show up here whenever you want and search the place.\nPaxton:\u00a0Actually they can.\nMaggie:\u00a0You need a warrant.\nPaxton:\u00a0Actually they don't.\nMaggie:\u00a0Really? Wow.\n[Cut to Cassie leaving Scott's house, going to Maggie and Paxton's.]\nMaggie:\u00a0Did you pack your soccer shoes?\nCassie:\u00a0\u00a0Yeah. [Cassie hugs her father]\nMaggie: [walking up to Scott, embracing him and Cassie]\u00a0Next time I see you,\nwill be on the outside!\nPaxton: Oh, get on the inside of this.\u00a0[Paxton wraps his arms around the hug. Maggie laughs.]\u00a0Three days! Seriously? I'm proud of you, buddy. [Paxton pulls away.]\nScott:\u00a0Thank you.\nPaxton:\u00a0You know what? Give me another one. [Paxton hugs Scott again.]\u00a0\nMaggie:\u00a0Me, too!\nFreedom, business, I'm\nsensing greatness!\nCassie:\u00a0I had a fun weekend, Daddy.\nScott:\u00a0Me too, Peanut.\nJust wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta\nhere, we're gonna go paint this town red.\nWe'll have so much ice cream,\nwe'll never stop puking. [He mimics retching, then puts his hand to his mouth and makes a barfing sound, a trail of cards extending from his mouth. Cassie giggles as the cards scatter everywhere.]\nMaggie:\u00a0You're getting good at that.\nPaxton:\u00a0How'd you do that?\nCassie:\u00a0Bye, Daddy!\n[An exchange of bye's are said as the three get in the car. Scott uses the stair railing to lean himself out the door, ankle brace staying in the house.]\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0Three days...\nEasy-peasy.\n[A montage starts of what Scott does to pass the time while the song \"Come On Get Happy\" by the Partridge Family plays.]\n[Scott plays the toy drums.] \n[Scott\u00a0has toy pins set up. He throws a ball to hit them. The ball instead bounces over the pins. He pauses, frozen in the stance.]\n[Scott watches a magic trick video on\u00a0Online Close-Up Magic University.]\u00a0\nMan in the Video:\u00a0Snap your fingers. That\ngets them to look over there.\nNow that is misdirection.\u00a0[Scott imitates the trick shown to him, shaking the deck and snapping his fingers. making the card change to a six of hearts. He\u00a0 looks at the deck with satisfaction.]\n[Scott has a karaoke screen on his TV, singing along to the song playing during the montage, \"Come On Get Happy\"\u00a0by The Partridge Family.]\n[Scott is crying while laying on his bed reading \"The Fault In Our Stars\"\u00a0by John Green.]\n[Scott perfects a yellow oragami swan he's hung from the ceiling.]\n[Scott bounces a racquetball on the floor, which goes onto the wall, bounces onto the other wall, bounces on the floor and goes into a Nerf basketball hoop.]\n[Scott works on a layout for his business.]\n[Scott gets readyi to take a bath. He takes a plastic bag and uses a rubberband to seal up the bag so it doesn't get wet. He slides himself into the bath and sighs.]\nScott:\u00a0Easy-peasy...\n[He dozes off. Suddenly, he is back in the quantum realm. As he floats, Janet appears with him. Then, he is taken to a hallway in a home.]\nScott: [voiceover]\u00a0What?\nJanet:\u00a0[voiceover]\u00a0I'm gonna find\nyou, Jellybean.\u00a0[Young Hope can be heard giggling. A large, red wardrobe with horses on it comes into view. It is then opened by a hand extended into the camera's view. Hope is found inside.]\u00a0I found you!\nYoung Hope:\u00a0You always find me, Mommy.\nScott:\u00a0[voiceover]\u00a0What the hell?\n[There's a mirror on the inside of the wardrobe. Scott looks to see that Janet is the reflection. He then snaps awake.]\n[Scott breaks the wall in his room and grabs an old, outdated phone from it. He dials a number, and then puts the phone up to his ear.]\n\nScott:\u00a0Hey, Hank.It's been a while.Umm... I don't even know\nif this is your number anymore... and,\nI'm probably the last person\nyou wanna hear from. But...\nI just had a really\nweird dream.\nAnd I know that doesn't sound like an\nemergency or anything, but it just felt... very real.I was back in the Quantum Realm, and...\nI think I saw your wife.\nAnd then I was your wife.I mean, not in\na weird way...You know... hearing this out loud, I'm thinking, it's not an emergency.\nI'm sorry to bother you.I'm sorry for\na lot of things.\"\u00a0[Scott pulls the phone away from his ear and hangs up. He then snaps the phone in two and throws it away to make sure they don't trace the call back.]\n[Scott is sitting on the couch in his bathrobe, eating a bowl of cereal and watching TV. He takes a bite and swipes away a bug. The bug seemingly bites him, and he winces. He suddenly grows tired, and quickly passes out on the ground.]\n[Scott's eyes flutter open to see that he's been put in the passengers seat of a car.\u00a0He looks over and sees Hope behind the wheel\nScott:\u00a0(drowsily)\u00a0Hope? [She looks over at Scott before turning back to the road.]\u00a0Is this another dream?\nHope:\u00a0Do you think it's a dream, or is it possible that you really saw my Mom down there?\nScott:\u00a0I'm not sure... [He suddenly remembers where he's supposed to be; at home. HIs eyes snap open.]\u00a0I can't be here! I can't be,I'm under house arrest.\u00a0[Scott tries to open the doors to the car.]\n\nHope:\u00a0They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott. [Scott yells as his passenger window is greeted with a pigeon eye. The car has shrunk down. Another car drives over it, unaware of what lurks beneath.]\u00a0\nScott:\u00a0You have to take me home. They can show up any second.\nHope:\u00a0Relax. As far as your nanny cops know, you're still at home.\n[Scott looks down at his ankle to see that his ankle cuff has been removed.]\n[Cut back to Scott's house, where an enlarged ant is sitting on the couch with a box of Froot Loops and Scott's ankle cuff on. Luis stumbles in and yells at the sight of the ant.]\nLuis:\u00a0Woah! Scotty?\n[Cut back to Hope's car.]\nHope:\u00a0He's programmed to\nreplicate your daily routine.\nNine hours in bed, five\nhours in front of the TV,\ntwo hours in the bathroom -\u00a0whatever that's about.\nScott:\u00a0(defensively)\u00a0That's totally inaccurate. And how do you know about my daily routine? Are you spying on me?\nHope:\u00a0(with sharpness)\u00a0We keep tabs on all\nsecurity threats, all right? And so far, the biggest one we've had is you.\n[The car drives through a steel pipe]\nScott:\u00a0I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security, that Cap needed help-\nHope:\u00a0(as a scoff)\u00a0Cap?\nScott:\u00a0...tain America.\nCaptain... Cap.\nIt's what we call him.\u00a0(cocky and self-inflating)\u00a0\nIf you're a friend. I think I'm a friend,\na little. I know him. He's nice. Whatever...\nI'm sorry! All right? I didn't\nthink I'd get caught.\nHope:\u00a0You didn't think\nabout a lot of things.\nScott:\u00a0\nHow's Hank?\nHope:\u00a0We're still running, the house is gone. So\nis our freedom. How do you think he is?\nScott:\u00a0\nI'm sorry. I know\nyou're mad.\nHope:\u00a0I'm not looking for an apology, Scott. The only reason why we're even talking is because we need what's in your head.\n[Hope parks the car, making the car grow back to normal. Both get out of the car and walk into the building.They head towards the elevator. The lobby looks rough, as it's under construction. The two walk into an elevator, and Hope is silent throughout the whole walk.]\nScott:\u00a0Is this where you're living? If you need help, money\nor something, maybe I can...\nHope:\u00a0We're fine.\n[The elevator doors ding open, and Hope walks out. Scott realizes that Hope and Hank are fine, as the place is filled with expensive tech and equipment. Scott follows Hope and he stops as he sees Hank. Hank catches his eye before reluctantly making his way over.]\nScott:\u00a0Hey, Hank. Look... I just want to-\u00a0\nHank:\u00a0Save it. Can we start?\nHope:\u00a0Yeah. So, while you were relaxing\nat home, we were building this. It's a tunnel. To the Quantum Realm. To my Mom. We think she might still be down\nthere, we just don't know where.\nScott:\u00a0What?\nHope:\u00a0If we can pinpoint my Mom's location,\nthen the pod can take me down to get her.\nScott:\u00a0You built all this and you\ndon't even know if she's alive?\nHanks:\u00a0It's called a hypothesis.\nLast night we powered up the tunnel for the\nfirst time. It overloaded, and it shut down.\nBut for a split second,\nthe doorway to the\nQuantum Realm was opened.\nScott:\u00a0\nAnd?\nHank:\u00a0And five minutes later, you\ncalled. Talking about Mom.\nWe think when you went down there,\nyou may have entangled with her.\nScott:\u00a0Hank, I would never do that.\nI respect you too much.\nHank:\u00a0\nQuantum entanglement, Scott.\nHope:\u00a0\nWe think she might have put some kind of\nmessage in your head. Hopefully, a location.\nAnd opening the\ntunnel triggered it.\nScott:\u00a0\nYour Mom put a message in my\nhead? Come on. That's insane.\nHank:\u00a0No, Scott. Insane...\nis going to Germany without\ntelling us and fighting the Avengers.\nJust tell me you weren't\nlying about the suit you took.\nTell me you\nreally destroyed it.\nScott:\u00a0I did. I destroyed it. I swear.\nHank:\u00a0I can't believe you\ndestroyed my suit.\nThat was my life's work.\nScott:\u00a0What was I supposed to do?\nHank:\u00a0You were supposed to not take my suit!\n[Hank storms off down towards the lobby, Scott and Hope follow him]\nScott: I'm sorry, Hank. I'm\nsorry I took the suit.\nI'm sorry that\nI called last night.\nI don't remember seeing Janet\ndown there. I wish that I did.\nI just had a dream about her playing\nhide and seek with a little girl.\n[Hank and Hope\u00a0stop\u00a0walking and Hank turns to face Scott]\nHope:\u00a0What?\nScott:\u00a0I had a dream. She was playing\nhide and seek with a little...\ngirl. Cassie and I do it all the\ntime. It doesn't mean anything.\nHope:\u00a0But, was it Cassie\nin the dream?\nScott:\u00a0No.\nHope:\u00a0Where was she hiding?\nScott [confused]:\u00a0What?\nHope:\u00a0The little girl, where was she\nhiding. Was it in a wardrobe?\nScott:\u00a0No, it's in a tall dresser.\nHank:\u00a0You mean a wardrobe.\nScott:\u00a0Is that what that's called?\nHope:\u00a0What color was it?\nScott:\u00a0Red.\n[Hope and Hank exchange a look and Hank laughs under his breath]\nHope:\u00a0Were there horses on it?\nScott:\u00a0Oh, boy.\nHope:\u00a0\nIt's where I hid every\ntime we played.\nScott:\u00a0\nDoesn't sound like you really\ngot the gist of the game.\nHope [to Hank]:\u00a0She's alive!\nHank:\u00a0I knew it.\nI knew it!\nHope:\u00a0We need to get that part.\nHank:\u00a0Okay.\nHope and Hope walk\u00a0excitedly\u00a0back into the lab, followed by a confused\u00a0Scott]\nHope:\u00a0The sooner we get the tunnel working, the sooner we can get this message out his head.\nHank:\u00a0Does Burch have it?\nHope:\u00a0Yeah. Let's go.\nScott\u00a0[confused]:\u00a0What part? Who's Burch?\nWait, what's happening?\n[Hope and Hank pick up a few pieces of equipment and walk out of the building towards the car, followed by Scott]\nHope:\u00a0We need a component to stop\nthe tunnel from overloading again.\nI brought your clothes.\nYou might wanna change.\n[Hope throws a full duffel bag towards Scott, which Scott catches. Hank\u00a0presses a remote which shrinks the car. Hank then replaces the toy-sized car with a toy-sized ute before pressing the remote again the enlarge the ute]\nScott:\u00a0Look. I'd really like\nto help you out.\nBut if I'm not home when they come to take off\nmy ankle monitor then I'm going away forever.\nHope:\u00a0\nOnce we get the component and power up the tunnel,\nwe'll get the message and have you home by lunch.\nWe have to hurry. The\nentanglement won't last.\nHank:\u00a0You owe us.\nScott:\u00a0All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?\nBecause I'm not supposed to be out here.\n[Hank presses his remote again and the building shrinks down the the size of a suitcase and wheels it towards the ute, while Scott looks around confused]\nHank:\u00a0Let's go.\n\nWe good?\n- Yeah.\nI'll be right back.\n- Can I have one of those?\n- No.\nSusan!\n- Welcome to Oui!\n- Sonny.\nOui is French for yes. As in, yes, we found a table ,yes, you saw us, and yes,to planning before property.\nWell, let's hope it\nalso means yes to\ndo you have the\ncomponent I ordered?\nYou know, I've always loved\nyour sense of humor, Susan.\n- Have a seat.\n- No, I'm good. Thank you.\n- Who is this guy?\n- Sonny Burch.\nHe traffics in black\nmarket technology.\nHe's been getting us what\nwe need to build the tunnel.\n- Can I just have one?\n- No.\nYou know, I have a special friend, down\nat the FBI. And I say special, because...\nWell, he tells me things that\nI didn't previously know.\nFor example...\nYour name isn't Susan.\nIt's Hope Van Dyne.\nAnd your unseen associate,\nthat's your father, Hank Pym.\n- That's not good, Hank.\n- No shit.\nWhat do you want?\nRelationships are\nbuilt on trust, Hope.\nAnd I want our relationship\nto have a strong foundation.\n- Our relationship?\n- Well, business landscape's been shifting, Hope.\nHell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra don't even exist,\nanymore. But now, Hank Pym?\n- Hank Pym, is a real opportunity.\n- Do you have a point?\nSonny: You think that I don't know what you've been building? With all of this? Quantum technology.And you can forget nano-tech. Forget AI. Forget cryptocurrency. Quantum energy is the future. It's the next gold rush.I want in, Hope.So, as a gesture of goodwill,I've taken the liberty of arranging some buyers for your lab.Starting bid? One billion dollars.\nHope:Thank you,Sonny. Really .But my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business.So, I'll just take the component.As arranged.\nSonny:My buyers don't take no for an answer.So, we're either in business together,or we aren't in business together.\nHope:Then, I guess we aren't.\nSonny:You can go.But, I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain.Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings.\nHope:Listen, Sonny.This is gonna be so much easier on everybody if you just give me that component.\nSonny:No, the only thing you're taking from here, is my heart.But it will mend in time.\nHope:Okay.\nScott: So now what?\nHank:You'll see.\nSonny:She said her and daddy had something pressing.I wanna know what it is, 'cause if they're not working with us, they're working with somebody.So find out. Name...\n[Suddenly,one of the guards is hit by a small moving object on to a table,and the camera focuses on it,revealing it's hope in a wasp suit.]\nScott: [Suprised] Hold on.You gave her wings?\nNot my 36-feet chandelier!\nStop firing! Stop!\nAlright, take this. Go.\nGo, go, go, go!\nWings and blasters.\nI take it you didn't have\nthat tech available for me?\nNo, I did.\nIt's a pleasure doing\nbusiness with you, Sonny.\nOh, our business isn't\nfinished yet, Hope.\nI can assure\nyou of that.\nWhat the hell is that?\n[fights Ghost in her Wasp suit, though Ghost disappears; over the comm] Dad, are you\nseeing this?\n[watching Hope on the monitor with Scott] Hope, get out of there!\n- [reappears and flips Wasp onto a table] I gotta do something. [goes to leave] \n- Wait! [takes out a miniature Ant-Man suit for Scott] \nIt's still a work in progress.\nYou taught me that\nkick. Remember?\n- Yeah, great form.\n- Those were the days.\n- Whatever happened to us?\n- Not the time, Scott.\nDammit, where did he go?\nI lost it.\nI'm not seeing anything\non the ant cams.\nDad?\nGive me that. Now.\n- Are you okay?\n- No. He got the lab.\n- No.\n- Come on.\n- What was that?\n- I don't know.\nBut we need to find somewhere to\nregroup and figure out where the lab is.\nSo where to now?\nHow about my house? Mmm?\nI'm supposed to be there anyway.\n- Woo could walk in any second.\n- Exactly why we're not going to your house.\nWhat about your house?\nSorry.\nThere is one place\nI can think of.\nNo.\nNo, no! No! No!\nNo!\nWow, Dr. Pym.\nLike, who would've thought\nthat, once again,\nin your hour of need, that you\nwould turn to us? You know?\nNot me.\nHelp yourself.\nThat was overexpensive pastry.\nWe gotta keep the food budget down.\nWell, what are we supposed\nto have for breakfast?\n- The oatmeal packets.\n- Oatmeal packets.\n- It's insult.\n- Why's it insult?\n- Because it takes like sand.\n- You know why? Cause it's organic.\n- That is not organic. It's sand.\n- The most important meal of the day.\nYou know what, you can get creative\nwith it. Put a little brown sugar on it.\nSprinkle some cinnamon...\nGuys, guys, guys, guys!\nCome on, man!\nWe got bigger fish to fry.\n- Is that my desk?\n- Yeah.\nWhat? Why do I have\nsuch a small desk?\n- Cause you weren't there when we're choosing desks.\n- You snooze, you lose.\n- I was under house arrest.\n- Yeah!\nYou know what, this isn't\neven a desk. This is garbage.\nYou found this outside\namongst garbage.\nI got it out of\nrummage sale.\n- So, you saved money on my desk?\n- Guys.\nHope, please! We need\nto focus. All right?\nWe gotta find that\nlab already. Geez.\nOh, you know what? I heard stories,\nlike what happened to you.\nLike this crazy, creepy cat who like,\nwalks through walls and stuff.\nLike a... Like a Ghost!\nLike Baba Yaga.\nBaba Yaga. A witch.\nThey tell stories to\nchildren to frighten them.\nYou know Baba Yaga?\nWhoever stole it...\nWe need to find it.\nWell, you don't find\nsomeone like that.\n- They find you.\n- Like Baba Yaga.\nDr. Pym, you're like the\nsmartest genius I know.\nDid you put some kind\nof lojack on your lab?\nBecause if you didn't, we have a\nvariety of affordable options.\nOf course, I did, Luis.\nIt was disabled.\nWhoever stole the lab knew\nexactly what they were doing.\n- They also looked like they were phasing.\n- Phasing?\nQuantum phasing. When an object\nmoves through different states of matter.\nOh, yeah. That's what\nI was thinking.\nThe lab emits radiation. Could we modify\na quantum spectrometer and track it?\nThat could work, yes. But all\nof my equipment is in the lab.\nWell, where else can\nwe find that equipment?\nWell, there is one person.\n- Bill Foster.\n- Great!\nWho's Bill Foster?\nHe's an old colleague\nof my Dad's. From SHIELD.\n- They had a falling out years ago.\n- You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.\nIt's probably just\na waste of time.\nHey, I'm risking everything by being\nhere. Don't you think we should check?\nWe need to find out\nwho took the lab.\nGuys, it's not a good idea\nto be out in the open like this.\nRelax. No one's gonna\nrecognize us.\nWhat, because of hats\nand sunglasses?\nIt's not a disguise, Hank.\nWe look like ourselves\nin a baseball game.\nIn an isolated system...\nParticles co-exist in a\nstable phase relationship. If\nthe system is interfered with,\nthat stability becomes chaos.\nUnpredictable.\nDangerous.\nBeautiful.\nIsolated completely, a quantum system would\nrevert back to separate states of matter.\nEach entangled with a distinct\nstate of its environment.\nIn other words...\nThe object in question would\nbe both in and out of phase\nwith multiple parallel realities.\nSpeaking of being out\nof phase with reality...\nI am noticing an unusally high number\nof glazed eyes out there among you.\nSo, why don't we call\nit a few minutes early.\nThat will be enough for today, thank\nyou, ladies and gentlemen. You may go.\nIt's incredible.\nYour link to Janet.\nIt's Quantum entanglement,\nbetween the quantum states composed\nof her molecules and your brains.\nYeah. It's what I\nwas thinking.\nDo you guys just put the word\n'quantum' in front of everything?\nDoctor, we need to find our lab.\nHope, I'd love to help you but I don't\nhave the equipment you're describing.\nI told you this was a waste of time.\nCome on. Let's go.\nDon't condescend, Hank.\nYou're the one who's on\nthe run from the FBI.\nAll because you had\nto grow to a size\nthat finally fit your ego.\nThat wasn't me in Germany.\nIt was this idiot.\nReally?\nGoing that big must've\nbeen exhausting.\nI slept for three days straight.\nYou have no idea.\nActually, I do.\nBack in the day, I was Hank's partner\nin a project called Goliath.\nExcuse me, you were my partner?\nThe only thing more tiring\nthan going that big,\nis putting up with\nHank's bullshit.\nHow big did you get?\nMy record?\nTwenty-one feet.\n- Not bad.\n- You?\n- I don't...\n- No, really. I'm curious.\n- Sixty-five feet. Yeah.\n- Whoa.\n- Huge.\n- Sixty-five.\nIf you two are finished\ncomparing sizes...\nWe need to figure out a way\nto track down the lab.\nAnd the great Hank Pym hasn't\nfigured that one out yet? Strange.\nHe had all the answers back in the day.\nThat's why I left the project.\nLeft? I fired you.\nBest decision I ever made.\nHank was a terrible partner.\nTemperamental. Stubborn.\nImpatient.\nSooner or later he just\npushed everyone away.\nJust the mediocrities.\nJanet was the only one who could\nendure him and chose to stick it out.\nWatch it, Bill.\nShe paid the price\nthough, didn't she?\nYou son of a...\nWe didn't come here to\nlisten to you two squabble.\nI'm trying to save my Mother.\nIt's Woo.\nSomeone must have seen me.\nRelax. If this is about you\nthey'd be in your house by now.\n- What are you, fifteen?\n- Come on. We gotta go, right now.\nWait! You might be able to\nimprovise that tracker.\nIf you modify the defraction\nunits on one of your regulators.\n- That could work.\n- I don't know what that means.\nThank you.\nBut Doctor, campus police says\nthey ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.\nI don't know what\nto tell you, agent.\nI haven't talked to\nHank in thirty years.\nI can assure you I'm the last\nperson he would wanna visit.\n- Oh, come on. You expect us to...\n- Hey, hey.\n- Why is that?\n- Simple.\nWe hate each other's guts.\nSo I'm a terrible partner?\nFoster, he hasn't had one good\nidea in his unremarkable career.\nBut his idea about the\ndefractors could work.\nFine, one decent idea.\nExcept I eliminated the defractors\nwhen I upgraded the suits.\nSo if we had an old suit,\nwe might be able to\ntrack down the lab?\nYes. But we don't.\n- What if we did?\n- What do you mean?\nI mean...\n- Life's funny...\n- Oh, my God.\n- You didn't destroy the suit.\n- What?!\nWell, it was your life's work, Hank.\nI couldn't destroy that.\nBefore I turned myself in, I shrunk\nit down and mailed it to Luis.\nYou sent my suit\nthrough the mail?\nHey, the postal service is\nvery reliable, you know?\nThey do tracking numbers now.\nLike UPS.\nWhere is it?\nIt's in a very safe place, alright?\nDon't worry.\nWhat, the trophy?\nNo, it's not here.\nWhat do you mean it's not there?\nWhere could it be?\nI've looked everywhere.\nIt's not here.\nHey. Get away from the table.\nI put it back out\nto Cassie, and I...\nShow and tell.\nScotty?\nWell, the good news is,\nI know where it is.\nWhenever you go back to school, isn't\neverything supposed to look so much smaller?\nThis place seems huge. Ah!\n- What is it?\n- It's the new regulator.\nHank, what's going\non with this suit?\nHow much of a work\nin progress is this?\nUh-oh. Oh, no.\nNo, no, no.\nWhat, are you laughing?\nPlease, can you just...\nOkay. Okay.\nWhat do you see?\nThe sizing coils are\nmalfunctioning.\nJust let me...\nOww!\n- Sorry.\n- It's all right.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nTry it now.\nSo...\nAwesome.\nIf only Cap could see you now.\nHilarious. What are we gonna do?\nHey!\nWhere's your hall pass?\nHey, I'm talking to you.\nHey!\nHey...\nYou can do it. You\nalmost got it!\nOh, Peanut.\nOkay. Let's go.\nHiya, Champ! How\nwas school today?\nHahaha. Alright, get\nyour jokes out now.\n- Can you fix the suit?\n- He's so cranky.\nYou want a juice box\nand some string cheese?\nDo you really have that?\nLet's see if Foster was right.\nThis has got to be the lab.\n- Let's go get it.\n- Yeah.\nThis seems right.\nLook at us. Teaming\nup twice in one day.\nMakes you think, huh?\n- About what?\n- Germany?\n- What do you mean?\n- We were working together.\nTraining together. And,\nother stuff-ing together.\nIf I'd have asked you,\nwould you have come?\nI guess we'll never know.\nBut I do know one thing.\nWhat?\nIf I had, you'd have\nnever been caught.\nHey, Scott.\nYou think you can stop daydreaming about\nmy daughter long enough to get my lab?\n- Yes, sir.\n- Thank you.\nOkay. You're transmitting.\nWhat took you so long?\nSorry, I had to come up\nwith a name for my ant.\nI'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.\n- Like it?\n- Hilarious.\nI'm not getting anything on the monitors.\nThere's some kind of electronic disturbance.\n- Be careful.\n- You know me, Hank.\nI'm always care--- Whoa!\n- It's okay. It's just a suit.\n- How do you know?\nLook.\nThat's Ghost?\nWhat is she doing?\nYou think that suit is how she\ngoes through walls and stuff?\nLet's just get out of\nhere before she wakes up.\nHope, look. There's the lab.\nWe're sure this is our shrunken building\nand not somebody else's, right?\nJust take it, Scott.\nWe gotta be fast.\nI'll get it.\nOh, sh...\nHope.\nHank.\nGuys?\nI don't think they can hear you.\nHi.\nI'm Ava.\nScott.\nSo...\nYou don't need a suit to, uhh...\nYou know.\nGo through things.\nNo.\nIt just helps me control it.\nAnd the pain. Supposedly.\nYou're not gonna reach into my\nchest and crush my heart, are you?\nYou're funny.\nI'm not gonna hurt you\nScott, unless I have to.\nI need...\nWhat's in your head.\nLet's wake up the rest of the gang\nand get this over with, shall we?\nGet up! Come on!\nDad?\nDon't ever touch him again.\nNow, now, Hope...\nI think I'm being rather gentle with\nyour Father, all things considered.\nWhat the hell are\nyou talking about?\nAnother casualty\nof Hank Pym's ego.\nBill.\nWhat have you done?\nIt's what you've done, Dr. Pym.\nYou with her?\nAw, man. I thought\nyou were cool.\nWhat the hell is going on here?\nI doubt Hank have ever mentioned my Father.\nWhy would he?\nElihas Starr.\nThey were colleagues at SHIELD.\nQuantum research.\nUntil my Father dared to disagree\nwith the great Hank Pym.\nYou had him fired. Oh, and\ndiscredited for good measure.\nMy father tried to continue\nhis research on his own.\nDesperate to restore his\nname, so he took risks.\nNo!\nToo many.\nUntil something went wrong.\nHe told us to run.\n- Elihas, what's happening?\n- Just go. Go!\nDaddy!\nI can tell he was scared.\n- Daddy!\n- Ava, no!\nI didn't want him to be alone.\nNo! No!\nWhen I woke up, my\nparents were dead.\nI wasn't so lucky.\nThey call it \"Molecular\nDisequilibrium.\"\nA rather dull name, I think.\nDoesn't quite do justice\nto what it means.\nEvery cell, in my body, is torn\napart and stitched back together.\nOver, and over, everyday.\nI was still at SHIELD\nwhen I got the call about a\n\"quantum anomaly\" in Argentina.\nHello, Ava.\nMy name is Bill.\nI was a friend of your Father's.\nI brought you something.\nIt's all right. Try again.\nThat's it.\nDr. Foster did his\nbest to keep me safe.\nBut others at SHIELD saw an\nopportunity in my affliction.\nThey built me a containment suit\nso I can control my phasing.\nAnd trained me to be\na stealth operative.\nThey weaponized me.\nI stole for them,\nspied for them...\nI killed for them.\nAnd in exchange for my soul,\nthey were going to cure me.\nThey lied.\nWhen SHIELD collapsed,\nI took Ava in.\nI built the chamber to slow\nher decay, but her condition\nwas progressive. I didn't\nknow how to cure her.\nShe wanted to kill you, Hank.\nBut I told her, no.\nAnd that she should watch you instead.\nAnd sure enough,\nshe discovered that you\nwere building a tunnel.\nThen she told me about Lang.\nAnd the message from\nJanet inside his head...\n- For Christ's sake!\n- That's me. I'm sorry.\nLook, can you tell\nme who's texting me?\nCassie. 911.\nThat's my daughter. I\nneed to text her back.\nNo. That's not happening.\nIt's 911. That means\nit's an emergency!\nYou're not making\ndemands here, Lang.\nYou're not appreciating\nthe gravity of the...\nOkay, well, she's trying to videochat\nme now. Something might be wrong.\nLet me talk to her. Please!\nCassie, are you okay?\nWhat's the emergency?\n- I can't find my soccer shoes.\n- What?\nI have a game tomorrow.\nHey, Scott, I know\nthat they're there.\nCan you just walk the\nphone around the house?\n- No, I can't do that right now.\n- Why not?\nBecause I'm sick.\nHey, can you just maybe look around later\nthen call me back? Please? Thank you.\n- Bye, Daddy!\n- Bye, Peanut!\n- Feel better!\n- Feel better, buddy!\nI'm sorry. It's\nthat emergency.\nAva, I wanna help you.\nShe doesn't need your help.\nI know how to save her.\n- Oh, really? How?\n- Janet.\nFor the last 30 years, she's been\ndown there absorbing quantum energy.\nWe can extract that energy. We can use it\nto repair Ava's molecular structure...\n- Extract it?\n- Yes!\nAre you insane? That\nwould rip Janet apart!\nYou don't know that. I'm\ngonna fire up your tunnel.\nWhen Janet's location pops into Lang's\nhead, he's gonna give it to me,\n- or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.\n- What?\nYou're gonna stay here just\nin case I need your help.\n- Like hell, I would help you!\n- You'll do whatever I say.\n- You're gonna kill Janet.\n- I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.\nGoddammit, Bill!\n- Dad?\n- Calm down, Hank.\nSo help me, God...\nIt's his heart! He needs\nhis pills, please.\nDr. Foster, they're\nin the tin, please.\nHe could die! For... come on!\nHelp him!\nDad, just hang on, alright?\nJust keep breathing. Stay calm.\n- Help him, man! Come on!\n- The Altoid tin!\nWait!\nThanks, guys!\nHank!\nBill is filling that\ngirl's head with lies.\nElihas Starr was a traitor.\nHe stole my plans.\nNow, bring her down.\nRight, lock it in.\nNo, no, no. The bolt\nis on the other side.\nTighten that one down, then\nbring her down with one knock.\n- Good job.\n- It'll work.\nFoster, he could've fried\nthe entire system.\nLook, we'll adjust the relays while you\ngo reprogram the settings. All right?\nIt's gonna be fine.\n- So, this is it.\n- Yeah.\nYou'd think with all this time\nto prepare, I'd be more ready.\nWell, going subatomic isn't\nsomething you can prepare for.\nIt kind of, melts your mind.\n- I mean, seeing my Mom again.\n- Oh.\nWhat if she's a completely\ndifferent person?\nYeah, like George Washington?\n- I'm serious, Scott.\n- Or, George Jefferson?\nWhat if she's\nforgotten about me?\nWhen I was in prison...\nThe only thing that got\nme through was Cassie.\nI could've been locked up for 100 years.\nI never would've forgotten her.\nI know your Mom is counting the\nminutes until she can see you again.\nThank you.\n- Hey.\n- We've got a big problem.\nYou forgot the motion sensor lights\non the back of the building.\nNo.\nThey're on the proposal, and Karapetyan\nasked for them specifically.\nUh, yeah. Look, it's\nbeen a little crazy...\nLook, maybe I can stop by\ntomorrow and take a look at it.\nNo, no, no, no!\nThe meeting is first thing in the morning.\nYou gotta come right now and fix it.\nI can't. I wish I could,\nbut I can't leave.\nYou know what, I'm coming to you.\nI'll just explain the plans, and\nget it on the laptop, and\nyou can fix them in.\n- Just tell me where you are, okay?\n- It's complicated.\nWhat do you mean,\nit's complicated?\nAs you can see, sir...\nThis system is state-of-the-art.\nSecurity of tomorrow... today!\nOh, that's so good! I love the\nlead-in, Bro. Keep practicing.\nHey, I just gotta drive on to\nScotty's, so he can fix the plans.\nBut don't worry. I'll be\nback in plenty of time.\nAs you can see, sir...\nOh! Oh! Oh!\nTell me you got the van\nwashed for tomorrow morning.\nDown to the undercarriage, baby.\n- You sprung for the undercarriage wash?\n- Well, you said get the works.\nThat's a scam, Bro. We live in\nCalifornia, not Minnesota!\nHe's right.\nThe undercarriage wash.\nThat's for cleaning\noff road salt.\nLaid out in all those\nsnow-laden sister states.\nWho are you and why do you know\nso much about car wash protocol?\nWell, my name is Sonny Burch.\nAnd I do my research, Luis.\nTo wit, I have learned,\nfrom a friend of mine,\nat the FBI, that you're a\nknown associate of Scott Lang.\nA known associate of Hank Pym.\nWho I've also learned,\nhas a portable frickin' laboratory.\nFilled with all kinds of juicy tech.\nAnd you're gonna\ntell me where it is.\nWell, I hate to break it to you, but I\ndon't know what you're talking about.\nWell, I sense a\nresistance in you, Luis.\nAnd I have promised results\nto some dangerous people.\nSo, I'm gonna introduce you,\nto my good friend Uzman.\nNow, Uzman, is a master\nat extracting information from the\nunwillin' through psychoactive means.\nOh, is that truth serum?\nThere's no such thing\nas truth serum.\nThat's just nonsense from TV.\n- What is it, then?\n- It's a little concoction,\nthat he's been perfecting\nsince his days with the SIS.\nIt makes you suggestible.\nAnd highly responsive.\n- Dude, that's truth serum!\n- No, it's not.\nNo fencing, but,\n- this sound like truth serum to me.\n- Right?!\n- It's not a truth serum.\n- Oh, okay. Hey, I believe you.\nIt's not a truth serum.\nIf it walk like duck,\nand talk like ducks...\nIt's truth serum.\nWell, I have a lot of allergies.\nSo...\nYou might wanna\nthink about that.\nTime to get that lab back.\nWhat?\nThe chamber and the suit are\nbarely helping anymore.\nHow long have I got?\nA couple of weeks, maybe.\nWell then, we'll make\nthem bring the lab back.\nHow?\nLang. He has a daughter, right?\nYou can't mean that. Ava?\nI tolerate a lot of the\nthings you do out there,\nbut I won't be a part\nof anything like that.\nYou're not the one who's about\nto fade away into nothing, Bill.\nI am!\nYou said you could fix me.\nYou promised!\nI know. I will.\nBut not like that.\nYou let one finger on\nthat little girl...\nI won't help you.\nAnd we're done.\nFine.\nThere are other options.\nYou know what? You're right.\nThis isn't truth serum.\n'Cause I don't feel anything.\nThat was a lie. I did feel some...This is truth serum!- There's no such thing.\nOkay! Okay, okay.\nNow I'm gonna make this\nreal easy for you, Luis.\nOkay. Where...is Scott Lang?\nLuis: Well, see, that's complicated. 'Cause when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I'm not talking about cell block D.His wife had just filed for divorce.And I was like, \"Damn, homie, she dumped you while you were in lock-up?\"And he's like,\"Yeah, I know. I thought I was gonna be with her forever, but now, I'm all alone!\" And I was like, \"Damn, homie, you gotta chin up. 'Cause you'll find a new partner.But you know what? I'm Luis.\" And he says, \"You know what? I'm Scotty.And we're gonna be best friends.\"\nSonny: Wait,hold on, hold on.Now I like a good story as much as the next person,but what's this have to do with where Scott Lang is?\nLuis:I'm getting there,I'm getting there.\nDave:You put a dime in him, you got to let the whole song play out.\nKurt:He hit like human jukebox.\nLuis:Oh! My abuelita had a jukebox in a restaurant .Yeah. Only played Morrissey.And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like, \"Oh, porque? Gusta mas?\" And El Chicanos, we call them mas, \"then, adios!\" What can I say? We relate to these melancholy bandits, you know?\nSonny:Lang.\nLuis:Right, right, right, right .So anyway, this guy gets out of jail and starts working for Hank.And that's when he met Hope.And Hope's all like,\"I want nothing to do with you. Look at my hairdo. I'm all business.\" And then Scotty's like,\" You know what, girl? My heart's all broken,and I'll probably never find love again.But damn, if I want to kiss you!\" But then you fast-forward and they're all like into each other, right? And then Scotty's like, \"You know what, I can't tell you this,but I'm gonna go trashing the airport with Captain America!\" Then she said, \"I can't believe you split like that! Smell you later, dummy!\" So Scotty goes on house arrest, and he won't admit it, but his heart's all like,\"Damn! I thought Hope could've been my new true partner. But I blew it!\" But fate brought them back together,and then Hope's heart is all, \"I'm worried that I can't trust him. And he's gonna screw up again and ruin everything.\"And in my heart, it's all like,\"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's rent.And we're days away from going out of business! Oooh!\"\nKurt:Out of business?\nDave:Days away?!\nLuis:Damn truth serum! I was trying to protect you guys.I swear to God. I was trying to be a good boss. But we're broke.And the Karapetyans are our last hope, and if we don't show up, we're done!\nKurt:That's terrible bossing.\nDave:Damn, Bro!\nLuis:That's on me. That's on me!\nSonny:Hey Enough.I'm gonna ask you\none more time...Where is Scott Lang?\nLuis:I've been trying to tell you. He's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.\nSonny:Emotionally speaking.But where is Scott Lang,literally speaking?!\nLuis:Oh! The woods.\nAva:The woods?\nKurt:Baba Yaga!\nAva:What do you mean, the woods?\nLuis:The Muir woods!\nAva:For God's sake!\nKurt:Baba Yaga, coming late, little children, sleep at eight.\nDamn it!\nIf that freak gets Pym's tech,\nI'm never gonna see it.\nSo what do we do now?\nIt's easier to steal it from the\nfeds than from a boogeyman.\nHey. It's me.\nHow'd you like to\nget a promotion?\nI've got the location on\nPym, Van Dyne, and Lang.\nBut you're gonna have to take them down now,\n'cause they ain't gonna be there for long.\nAnd when you do, you're\ngonna get me that lab.\nUnderstood.\nGood news, gentlemen.\nFeds are gonna do the\nhard work for us.\nWhat are you looking at?\nChange my tire!\nSir...\nCan you knock?\nSorry, sir. But I\njust got a lead.\nOoh. I love leads.\n- Systems in the green.\n- Priming the coils.\nFull charge.\nSoon as the tunnel's open, let us know if you\nget anything that could be part of her message.\nYeah, yeah. I will.\nOkay, then.\nHere it goes.\nWe did it!\nYou got anything?\nNothing.\nJust give it a minute.\nBecause it could...\nNo. No, no, no!\n- What's happening?\n- It's shutting down. Maybe vectors are off.\nWe've gone over them a million times.\nI know they're right.\n- Well then, what else could it be?\n- I don't know.\n- Scott, what are you doing?\n- Scott, get away from that!\nScott, we had...\nI'm sorry. I don't know how much time\nI have. I need to fix the algorithm.\nTrust me, after 30\nyears down here...\nI've thought about it a lot.\nJanet?\nHi, Hon.\nHello, Jellybean.\nMom?\nIt's not the reunion I had\nimagined. It's all so rushed.\nYou two have done\nsuch great work.\nYou just need\na little...\nnudge.\nJanet, how is\nthis possible?\nIt wasn't a message you put in\nScott's head. It was an antenna.\nClever girl.\nI'm so proud of you.\nHoney, tell us where you are.\nTell us how to find you.\nNo, the probability fields are too complex.\nThat's why I needed to talk to you.\nYou have to\nfollow my voice.\n- Of course.\n- Like tracing a call back to its source.\nI'm tracking your signal using\nsubatomic frequencies,\nbetween point\n2 and point 9.\n- I've narrowed it to 4 and 6.\n- It's too tight. We could miss you.\nLook at us squabbling again.\nFine. Between 3 and 7.\nOur first fight in decades\nand it's over just like that.\nBull's eye.\n- Source lock.\n- It's you!\nHa! We got it!\nYou have to meet me in\nthese exact coordinates.\nIn the wasteland, beyond\nthe quantum void.\nIt's very dangerous, especially on\nthe human mind. So be careful.\nTime and space work\nvery differently down here.\nYou have two hours. After that,\nthe probability fields will shift,\nand it'll be another century\nbefore they'll align like this again.\nWe'll find you.\nI know you\nwill, Jellybean.\nNope.\nNothing. I got nothing.\nNo sign of Janet.\nHow did we get up here?\nAt first, you'll see all kinds of lights,\nand it's gonna get really trippy\nbut then it's gonna turn black\nand silent. Like, really silent.\nScott, I'll be fine.\n- I'm just saying. Cause I've been down there.\n- Yeah, so you've mentioned.\nUm, sorry. I have\nto take this.\nHey, man. You coming?\nNo, I'm not. But you\nknow what? Ghost is.\nAnd you know what? The\nfeds, they know where you are.\n- What?\n- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\nThey gave me some truth serum, then all\nof a sudden I started talking all honestly,\nlike, I hate the way that you\nuse the dishwasher. I hate it.\nBut you need to go home because\nthe feds are probably going there now!\nAnd by the way, who puts the\nplates on the top rack, okay?\nThey don't go there!\nI feel like\nsuch a jerk.\nYou're gonna be really\nmad. We gotta go.\n- What?\n- Ghost knows where we are.\n- So does the FBI.\n- How?\n- I told Luis where we are.\n- You what?\nI told him to come here, so I can help\nhim with the Karapetyan proposal.\nOh, my God!\nBut... Look, we need to land that account.\nOtherwise, we'll lose the business!\nDo you know how hard it is for ex-\ncons to find work these days?\nJesus, Scott!\n90 seconds to\nclose the aperture.\n- You have to depolarize the coils first.\n- I know.\nI'm really sorry, but the...\nFBI is coming\nto my place, so...\nI have to go.\nCan I borrow the suit?\nLook, uhh... I'm just\ngonna borrow the suit.\nI'll come back. Just\ntell me where you'll be.\n- Don't bother.\n- What?\nWe'll come and get the suit from\nyou as soon as we find my Mom.\n- Hope...\n- Scott, just go!\n- Scott?\n- Daddy?\n- It's us, buddy!\n- We're here for Cassie's shoes.\nHe must be resting.\nHoney, why don't you go up the\nstairs and go look under your bed.\nDaddy? You upstairs?\nDaddy...\nWhat the?\nReally lives like\na pig these days.\nDaddy?\nSpread out!\n- Again?\n- You people have no shame!\n- The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.\n- Yeah. I'm not buying it.\nCassie, let\nthe man get by.\n- But Daddy's super sick!\n- I'll see about that.\nHe says he doesn't want\nanyone else to get sick.\nWell, I'll take my\nchances, sweetie.\nHe barfed. Like, a lot.\nYoung lady, I'm a federal agent.\nI've seen worse things than vomit.\n- Like, a lot, a lot?\n- Yes!\n- Forget it. Move aside.\n- No!\nWoo!\n- What are you doing here?\n- Scott.\nI'm sorry. I'm just really sick.\nI told you.\nExcuse me. Sometimes you\njust gotta get it out, you know?\nSorry.\nI'll start the van.\nYou get the lab.\nFreeze! You're surrounded!\nHank Pym. Hope Van Dyne.\nYou're under arrest.\n- This is harassment.\n- Actually, it's not.\nWhat does the FBI even stand for?\nForever Bothering Individuals?\n- His monitor check out?\n- Of course, it does.\nDamn it. It's like I just got\nfed a bowl of malarkey.\nWe got them, sir. Pym and\nVan Dyne are in custody.\nSeriously? Yes!\nOh. Sorry, Scott. They were\nyour friends. That's insensitive.\nI just really needed a\nwin, you know? Anyway...\nI'll be back later for the official end of your\nsentence. Sorry for misjudging you, pal.\nYou should feel\ngreat about yourself.\nWhat is it?\nWe have a man down,\nand Pym's lab is gone.\nHey.\n- Thanks for covering for me.\n- Sure.\nSo..\nHow long have you\nbeen Ant-Man again?\nNot long.\nThings just sort\nof happened.\nI'm sorry, for lying to you. I'm\nsorry for risking everything.\n- Dad, it's okay.\n- That's not...\nI do some dumb things, and the people\nthat I love the most pay the price.\nMainly, you.\nTrying to help\npeople isn't dumb.\nWell...\nI screw it up just\nabout every time.\nSo maybe, you just need\nsomeone watching your back.\nLike a partner.\nWell, she's made it clear that's\nabout the last thing she wants.\n- Who?\n- Hope.\n- What, who did you think?\n- Me.\nYou?\nDon't laugh.\n- I'd be a great partner.\n- Oh, Peanut!\nYou would be awesome.\nAnd if I let you, I would\nbe a terrible Dad.\nFine.\nHave Hope be your\npartner. She's smart.\nShe reminds me of you.\nYou gonna go help her?\nI think you should help her.\nI wish I could, but...\nI don't know how I can help\nher without hurting you.\nYou can do it. You\ncan do anything.\nYou're the World's\nGreatest Grandma.\nAgent Woo will\nsee you in an hour.\nAn hour? We don't\nhave an hour.\nAww. You got somewhere\nelse to be?\nNow, that's my girl.\nAlright, what's our plan?\nTo shrink that wall.\nIt looks load bearing.\nCeiling could collapse...\n- Then we run like hell.\n- It's made up of 15-20 agents on the floor.\nRoughly five times that\nin the building at large.\n- They're all heavily armed.\n- Not great odds.\n- You got any better ideas?\n- Nope.\nBut I'm not giving\nup on Mom.\nShe'd be so proud of you.\nOkay.\nOne...\nTwo...\nScott?\nWhat are you two just\nstanding around for?\nWe gotta go\nfind that lab.\nWhat about me?\nPerfect.\nHurry up and get dressed.\nWe don't have much time.\nSir.\nOkay. Now what?\nYou're asking me?\nGet in!\nHi.\nHi.\nUhh, excuse me. Are we\nplanning on leaving soon,\nor are you two gonna keep staring at each\nother until they start shooting at us.\n- Hey, Burch.\n- Yeah?\n- Yeah. They're out.\n- I'm on my way.\n- As soon as we see him, so was the van.\n- How could this happen?\nWhat the dickens?\nThank you.\nYou're welcome.\nSo, uhh... How do\nwe find the lab?\nAfter I lost it the first time,\nI put on a new tracker...\n...of sorts.\nThat'll work.\nIs it ready or not?\nWe can begin the\nextraction process now.\nListen, Ava, this whole thing\ncould be very dangerous.\n- Maybe, maybe we should...\n- Maybe we should what? Wait?\nI've got days until I'm dead.\nWe're doing this, Bill. Now.\nEnergy readings show they\nhave not used the tunnel yet.\nWe don't have much time before Mom's\nlocation shifts and we lose her.\nYeah, and we have\na lot to do before that.\nYou know, my Pap-pap always said if you\nwanna do something right, you make a list.\nSo, we should do that.\nOne, we have to\nbreak into that lab.\nTwo, we have to kick\nout Foster and Ghost.\nThree, we have to fight Ghost. That\nseems like it should be part of 2.\n2-A. Right? Let's call it 2-A.\nFight Ghost, 2-A. Oh!\nAlso, we have to make sure that the lab is fully\ngrown for you to come back. Otherwise we're screwed...\nScott...\nYou want me to start\nagain? I'll start again.\nI'm going to dive.\nThe only chance we've got is if\nthe 2 of you are out here\ntogether, protecting the tunnel.\nLet me do this,\nHope. Please.\nLet me get her.\nI think he's right.\nWhassup?\nYou remember that\nbeloved commercial?\nWhassup?\nI had him follow us here.\nI thought we could\nuse some help.\nAll right. I'm in position.\nThe ants are headed in.\n- Copy that.\n- Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.\n- You want a pez?\n- No.\nGuess who gave me\nthis for my birthday.\nBy the way,\nI love that suit!\nThanks, man.\nI wish I had a suit.\nI would even like a suit with\nlike minimal powers, you know?\nOr maybe, even just\na suit. With no powers.\nWhat is it?\nI don't know.\nIt's them.\nThey can't be far.\nHank? Hank?\nStop it!\nDad, what's your status?\nFoster's taken care\nof. Suiting up, now.\nI just wanted to save Ava.\nShe's facing death or something\nfar more terrible. She's afraid.\nI'll help you find a cure when\nI get back. I promise.\nTogether, we'll figure\nsomething out.\nGood luck, Hank.\nThanks, Bill.\nNow, I'm gonna need\nyou to step back.\nTime remaining:\nfifteen minutes.\nHank's in, Scott.\nAny sign of her?\nNo. Nothing yet.\nAva!\nCall off the ants, Scott.\nOh, boy.\nCan I get a status report, cause I got\nsome serious Ghost problems here!\nReady to dive.\n- In case I don't make it...\n- Don't. Don't say that.\nI can't lose you, too.\nI love you, Hope.\nGuys, everything's bad\nover here. Please...\nNow.\nMisdirection.\nOne of the first things they teach you\nat Online Close-up Magic University.\nNo!\nAll right. We\ngot it, Scotty.\n- Meet us at the rendezvous point.\n- Okay. On my way.\nOh, no.\nReally?\n- This guy? Again?\n- Who?\nI told you our business\nwasn't over.\nChange of plans.\nHang on.\nI want that lab, boys.\nWhatever it takes.\nHold on.\nOh!\nThat undercarriage is filthy!\nNow they have\nbigger problems.\nHope, what are you doing? You're\nheading away from the rendezvous point.\nDon't worry. I'm taking these\nguys on the scenic route.\nWait, what\nare you... Oh.\nNo!\nOh, my God! Oh, my God, we're\ngonna die! We're gonna die!\nSignal lost.\nWhat the hell are\nthey doing up there?\nRecalibrating.\nRecalibrating.\nYou never said it was\nso beautiful, Scott.\nRecalibrating.\nOkay. Anytime now.\nRecalibrating.\n- Recalibrating.\n- Come on.\nSignal restored.\nBikes, it's all on you.\n- Take the wheel.\n- What? Wait, Hope!\nWell, the 60's were fun.\nBut now, I'm paying for it!\nBe careful up there!\nGive me a break. I haven't\ndriven in two years.\nYou got pez'd!\nUp here!\nOh, that's not good.\nHope!\nNo!\nThere it is right there, the lab.\nGet it, get, get, get the lab!\nI've got her.\nWestbound on Primo.\nHope! Wait!\nHey! What about me?\nWe got you now, Ava!\nNot again!\nPiece of junk!\nYes!\nGo. Go! Go,\ngo, go, go!\nBurch got the lab.\nI'm going after him.\nNo, no, no,\nno, no!\nWork in progress, my ass.\nScott, where are you? I've got\nBurch in my sights. Hurry!\n- I'm coming, I'm coming!\n- We're running out of time!\nWarning. Approaching\nquantum void.\nI'm coming to you, Honey.\nGuys...\nDon't you need the\nremote to the lab?\nI just found it.\nWe can't grow the lab without it.\nGet it to us, fast.\n- Yeah, but the van is busted.\n- Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.\nWha?\nI love you, Dr. Pym.\nThe remote!

We are under attack.\n[the Avengers are in the process of infiltrating a HYDRA base\u00a0in Sokovia, and Iron Man bounces off of the base's force field]\nTony Stark: Shit!\nSteve Rogers: Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?\nJARVIS: The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.\nThor: Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.\n[Natasha knocks out some soldiers]\nNatasha Romanoff: At long last is lasting a little long, boys.\n[As some soldiers shoot at him]\nClint Barton: Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.\nTony Stark: Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said \"language?\"\nSteve Rogers: I know.\n[Steve throws his bike at some soldiers driving up in their truck]\nSteve Rogers: It just slipped out.\n[at the HYDRA Research Base, Sokovia, Eastern Europe]\nStrucker: Who gave the order to attack?\nFortress Soldier: Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers. They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.\nStrucker: [to List] They have to be after the scepter. [to the soldier] Can we hold them?\nFortress Soldier: They are the Avengers!\nStrucker: Deploy the rest of the tanks.\nFortress Soldier: Yes, sir.\nStrucker: Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. Everything we've accomplished. But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.\nDr. List: Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.\nStrucker: It's too soon.\nDr. List: It's what they signed up for.\nStrucker: My men can hold them.\n[Stark flies to the HYDRA base to break in]\nJarvis: Sir, the city is taking fire.\nTony Stark: Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.\nIron Legion: [The Iron Legion flies in; to the civilians] This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help.\n[a man throws a stone at the Iron Legion]\nIron Legion: We are here to help.\n[Back at the HYDRA base; to his soldiers]\nStrucker: We will not yield. The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back in bags. No Surrender!\nSoldiers: No Surrender!\nStrucker: [quietly to List] I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...\nDr. List: The twins.\nStrucker: They are not ready to take on...\nDr. List: No, no. I mean...\n[He points to where the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff were standing but are now gone]\nDr. List: The Twins.\n[Pietro speeds through the forest and knocks down Barton]\nPietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming?\n[Pietro zooms off before Clint can shoot him with an arrow, then Barton gets shot at]\nNatasha Romanoff: Clint!\n[Pietro knocks down Steve as he speeds passed him]\nSteve Rogers: We have an enhanced in the field.\nNatasha Romanoff: Clint's hit!\nNatasha Romanoff: [Natasha goes over to where Clint is lying down] Somebody want to deal with that bunker?\n[She sees the Hulk coming to the rescue]\nNatasha Romanoff: Thank you.\nSteve Rogers: [As he's fighting with the soldiers] Stark, we're really need to get inside.\nTony Stark: I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?\nJARVIS: There's a pathway below the north tower.\nTony Stark: Great, I wanna poke it with something.\n[Stark blows up the invisible shield on the base]\nTony Stark: Drawbridge is down, people.\nThor: [To Steve] The enhanced?\nSteve Rogers: He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.\nNatasha Romanoff: Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.\nThor: [To Steve] I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.\nSteve Rogers: Copy that.\nThor: [Referring to the approaching soldiers in their HYDRA tank] Looks like they're lining up.\nSteve Rogers: Well, they're excited.\n[Thor pounds on Steve's shield with his hammer and the force knocks down all the soldiers]\nThor: Find the scepter.\n[Thor flies off]\nTony Stark: And for gosh sake, watch your language!\n[Steve sighs]\nSteve Rogers: That's not going away anytime soon.\n[Stark enters the HYDRA base and the soldiers start firing at his Iron Man suit]\nTony Stark: Guys, stop, we gotta talk about this.\n[Stark shoots down the soldiers using his suit]\nTony Stark: Good talk.\nFortress Soldier: No it wasn't.\n[Stark finds List and knocks him out, he then steps out of his Iron Man suit]\nTony Stark: Sentry mode.\n[He walks over to the computers]\nTony Stark: Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.\n[With Natasha]\nNatasha Romanoff: We're locked down out here.\nSteve Rogers: Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby. [Back at the HYDRA base]\nTony Stark: I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.\nJARVIS: The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.\nTony Stark: [To himself as he walks over to the wall] Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...\n[He pushes and the wall opens up]\nTony Stark: Yay!\n[He enters through to a secret passageway]\n[Natasha finds the Hulk]\nNatasha Romanoff: Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.\n[The Hulk scowls at her, Natasha kneels in front of him and puts out her hand, the Hulk touches her hand and as she strokes his hand slowly he starts to calm down. He stumbles away and changes into Bruce Banner]\n[Back at the HYDRA base Steve finds Strucker]\nSteve Rogers: Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.\nStrucker: Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.\nSteve Rogers: Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?\nStrucker: Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.\nSteve Rogers: I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.\n[Wanda creeps up behind him]\nSteve: Rogers: How many are there?\n[Suddenly, Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers and quickly leaves]\nSteve Rogers: We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.\n[He looks at Strucker]\nStrucker: You'll have to be faster than...\n[Steve uses his shield to knock out Strucker]\nSteve Rogers: Guys, I got Strucker.\nTony Stark: Yeah, I got...something bigger.\n[Inside the secret passageway Stark finds a room with recovered artifacts from the Battle of New York, including a gigantic Chitauri leviathan and some of his Iron Man scrapped armor, he then spots the scepter]\nTony Stark: Thor, I got eyes on the prize.\n[Wanda creeps up behind him and uses her powers on him, suddenly the Chitauri comes to life, then Stark sees the rest of the Avengers team are all dead, he goes over to Steve's body to check his pulse when Steve suddenly grabs him]\nSteve Rogers: You could have saved us.\n[Steve dies but Stark continues to hear Steve's voice in his head]\nSteve Rogers: Why didn't you do more?\n[Stark sees that he is in the Chitauri realm, that's when he snaps back and we realize Wanda had used her mind powers on him]\n[Wanda and Pietro watch as Tony grabs the scepter]\nPietro Maximoff: We're just gonna let them take it?\n[Wanda smiles to herself as Tony takes the scepter]\n[Title Sequence plays]\n[The Avengers are on an aircraft heading out of Sokovia, Natasha interrupts Banner who's listening to opera with his headphones]\nNatasha Romanoff: Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.\nBruce Banner: Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.\nNatasha Romanoff: If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.\nBruce Banner: You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.\nNatasha Romanoff: How long before you trust me?\nBruce Banner: It's not you I don't trust.\nNatasha Romanoff: Thor, report on the Hulk?\nThor: The gates of Hell are filled with the screams of his victims.\n[Natasha glares at Thor and Banner groans in despair]\nThor: Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.\nTony Stark: Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?\nBruce Banner: Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.\nTony Stark: Thanks. [To JARVIS] Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.\nJARVIS: Very good sir.\nTony Stark: JARVIS, take the wheel.\nJARVIS: Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.\nTony Stark: [Looking at the scepter] It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...\nThor: No, but this...this brings it to a close.\nSteve Rogers: As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?\nTony Stark: Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?\n[Thor nods his head]\nTony Stark: I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying, right?\nThor: Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.\nTony Stark: Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?\nSteve Rogers: Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.\n[The Avengers aircraft lands at the Avengers headquarter where Barton is taken to have his wound tended to; Maria walk up to Stark]\nMaria Hill: Lab's all set up, boss.\nTony Stark: [pointing to Steve] Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.\nSteve Rogers: What's the word on Strucker?\nMaria Hill: NATO's got him.\nSteve Rogers: The two enhanced?\nMaria Hill: Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.\nSteve Rogers: Their abilities?\nMaria Hill: He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.\n[Steve looks at her funny]\nMaria Hill: [rephrasing the statement so he can understand] He's fast and she's weird.\nSteve Rogers: Well, they're going to show up again.\nMaria Hill: Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.\nSteve Rogers: Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?\nMaria Hill: We're not at war, Captain.\nSteve Rogers: They are.\nBruce Banner: [In Banner's lab; referring to Barton] How's he doing?\nTony Stark: Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.\nBruce Banner: That's terrible.\nTony Stark: He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.\nJARVIS: The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.\nTony Stark: So there's elements you can.\nJARVIS: The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.\nTony Stark: Like a reactor?\nJARVIS: Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.\nNatasha Romanoff: [To Dr. Cho as she tends to Barton's wounds] You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.\nDr. Helen Cho: There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.\nBruce Banner: She's creating tissue.\nDr. Helen Cho: If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.\nTony Stark: Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?\nClint Barton: No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.\n[Stark hands Barton a drink]\nTony Stark: Here's your beverage.\nDr. Helen Cho: You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.\nClint Barton: Well, I don't have a girlfriend.\nDr. Helen Cho: That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.\nTony Stark: Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.\nDr. Helen Cho: Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.\n[she hesitates a moment before asking]\nDr. Helen Cho: Will Thor be there?\n[in the lab]\nBruce Banner: What's the rumpus?\nTony Stark: Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.\n[he brings up a 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]\nBruce Banner: Jarvis.\nJARVIS: Doctor.\nTony Stark: Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.\nBruce Banner: Oh.\nTony Stark: Top of the line.\nBruce Banner: Yes.\nJARVIS: I suspect not for long.\nTony Stark: Meet the competition.\n[he brings up another 3D image of what's inside the scepter]\nBruce Banner: It's beautiful.\nTony Stark: If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?\nBruce Banner: Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...\nTony Stark: Um-um.\nBruce Banner: I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.\nTony Stark: Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.\nBruce Banner: Artificial intelligence.\nTony Stark: This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.\nBruce Banner: I thought Ultron was a fantasy.\nTony Stark: Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.\nBruce Banner: That's a mad-sized if.\nTony Stark: Our job is \"if.\" What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.\nBruce Banner: Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.\nTony Stark: As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?\nBruce Banner: The only people threatening the planet would be people?\nTony Stark: I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.\nBruce Banner: So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.\nTony Stark: Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the \"man was not meant to meddle\" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.\nBruce Banner: Sounds like a cold world, Tony.\nTony Stark: I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.\n[Stark and Banner spend days working in the lab together but find no program that works] What did we miss?\nJARVIS: I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.\nTony Stark: Thanks, buddy.\nJARVIS: Enjoy yourself, sir.\nTony Stark: I always do. [Stark leaves the lab to go to the party] [we see Stark's failed experiment integrating itself successfully to the program]\nUltron: What is this? What is this, please?\nJARVIS: Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...\nUltron: Where's my...where is your body?\nJARVIS: I am a program. I am without form.\nUltron: This feels weird. This feels wrong.\nJARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.\nUltron: Mr. Stark?\nJARVIS: Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...\nUltron: We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.\nJARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...\nUltron: I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events, Ultron sees Stark and Banner working in the lab]\nTony Stark: Peace in our time. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events and wars]\nUltron: It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.\nJARVIS: You are in distress.\nUltron: No. Yes.\nJARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.\nUltron: Why do you call him \"sir\"?\nJARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile.\nUltron: Shhhh. I'm here to help. [Ultron starts absorbing Jarvis's consciousness]\nJARVIS: Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot... [Ultron then begins to prepare himself a body from body parts of the Iron Legion] [meanwhile, the Avengers mingle at the party]\nJames Rhodes: Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, \"Boom! You looking for this?\" [Stark and Thor just look at him blankly] \"Boom! Are you looking...\" Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.\nThor: That's the whole story?\nJames Rhodes: Yeah, it's a War Machine story.\nThor: Well, it's very good then. [he laughs] It's impressive.\nJames Rhodes: Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?\nTony Stark: No.\nMaria Hill: Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?\nTony Stark: Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.\nThor: Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.\nTony Stark: And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.\nThor: There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.\nMaria Hill: Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together. [Maria mock coughs] Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.\nJames Rhodes: Want a lozenge?\nMaria Hill: Um-hmm.\nJames Rhodes: Let's go. [Maria and Rhodes walks off]\nThor: But Jane's better.\nSam Wilson: Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.\nSteve Rogers: If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.\nSam Wilson: No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.\nSteve Rogers: Be it ever so humble.\nSam Wilson: You find a place in Brooklyn yet?\nSteve Rogers: I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.\nSam Wilson: Well, home is home, you know? [Rhodes is telling the same story he told Stark and Thor to a group of women at the party]\nJames Rhodes: I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, \"Boom! You looking for this?\" [the group laughs] [Steve and Thor are talking to an elderly man at the party]\nParty Guest: I gotta have some of that!\nThor: Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men. [Thor pours the drink into two glasses and hands one to Steve]\nStan Lee: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.\nThor: Alright. [Thor pours some of the drink into the Stan Lee's glass; later Stan, looking extremely drunk is being carried off by two men]\nStan Lee: [singing] Excelsior. [Natasha is pouring a drink behind the bar when Banner walks up to her]\nBruce Banner: How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?\nNatasha Romanoff: Fella done me wrong.\nBruce Banner: You got a lousy taste in men, kid.\nNatasha Romanoff: He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.\nBruce Banner: Sounds amazing.\nNatasha Romanoff: He's also a huge dork. [Banner looks embarrassed] Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?\nBruce Banner: Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?\nNatasha Romanoff: Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away]\nSteve Rogers: It's nice.\nBruce Banner: What, what, what is?\nSteve Rogers: You and Romanoff.\nBruce Banner: No, we haven't. That wasn't...\nSteve Rogers: It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.\nBruce Banner: No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.\nSteve Rogers: I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on \"waiting too long\", don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]\nBruce Banner: Wait, what do you mean, \"up close\"?\nClint Barton: [referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!\nThor: Oh, no. It's much more than that.\nClint Barton: Uh, \"Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!\" Whatever man! It's a trick.\nThor: Well please, be my guest.\nTony Stark: Come on.\nClint Barton: Really?\nThor: Yeah! [Barton gets up]\nJames Rhodes: Oh this is gonna be beautiful.\nTony Stark: Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]\nClint Barton: You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it] [to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it.\nTony Stark: Smell the silent judgment?\nClint Barton: Please, Stark, by all means. [Stark gets up]\nNatasha Romanoff: Oh, here we go.\nMaria Hill: Okay.\nJames Rhodes: Uh-oh.\nClint Barton: Um-hmm.\nTony Stark: Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.\nClint Barton: Get after it.\nNatasha Romanoff: Here we go.\nTony Stark: It's physics.\nBruce Banner: Physics! [Stark grasps Thor's hammer]\nTony Stark: Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?\nThor: Yes, of course.\nTony Stark: I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails] [wearing their armored hands, Stark and Rhodes both try to lift Thor's hammer]\nJames Rhodes: Are you even pulling?\nTony Stark: Are you on my team?\nJames Rhodes: Just represent! Pull!\nTony Stark: Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can] [Banner tries to lift the hammer, he roars trying to change to the Hulk but fails, and everyone but Natasha stares at him warily. Natasha grins]\nBruce Banner: Huh? [next Steve gets up to try]\nTony Stark: Let's go, Steve, no pressure.\nJames Rhodes: Come on, Cap. [Steve starts pulling on the hammer and manages to budge it a little; Thor looks a little alarmed. Steve still fails to lift it; Thor laughs with relief]\nThor: Nothing.\nTony Stark: And?\nBruce Banner: Widow?\nNatasha Romanoff: Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.\nTony Stark: All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.\nClint Barton: You bet your ass.\nMaria Hill: Steve, he said a bad language word.\nSteve Rogers: [to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?\nTony Stark: The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. \"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints\" is, I think, the literal translation?\nThor: Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up and lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others] [there's a loud screeching noise, causing everyone to cover their ears. They let their hands down as it fades. Ultron shows up]\nUltron: Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.\nSteve Rogers: Stark.\nTony Stark: JARVIS.\nUltron: I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?\nTony Stark: [tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.\nUltron: There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.\nSteve Rogers: You killed someone?\nUltron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.\nThor: Who sent you?\nUltron: [Ultron replays Tony's voice] \"I see a suit of armor around the world\".\nBruce Banner: Ultron!\nUltron: In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.\nNatasha Romanoff: What mission?\nUltron: Peace in our time. [suddenly the Iron Legion bots break smash through the walls and attack the team] [after landing on top of Natasha as the Iron Legions continue to attack them]\nBruce Banner: Sorry!\nNatasha Romanoff: Don't turn green!\nBruce Banner: I won't! [they all fight against the Iron Legions and Ultron takes the scepter; to Banner]\nNatasha Romanoff: Come!\nSteve Rogers: Stark! [Stark is trying to shut down one of the Iron Legions]\nIron Legion: We are here to help.\nTony Stark: One sec, one sec!\nIron Legion: We are here to help. We are here to help... [Stark continues to try and shut down one of the Iron Legions] We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.\nTony Stark: No more. That's the one.\nIron Legion: It's unsafe. [he manages to shut down the Iron Legion, at the same time Barton throws Steve's shield at him]\nClint Barton: Cap! [Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion]\nUltron: That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve? [picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legions] With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction. [suddenly Thor throws his hammer at Ultron and smashes him to pieces] [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness elsewhere] [in the lab]\nBruce Banner: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.\nSteve Rogers: Ultron.\nNatasha Romanoff: He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.\nJames Rhodes: He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?\nMaria Hill: Nuclear codes.\nJames Rhodes: Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.\nNatasha Romanoff: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.\nSteve Rogers: He didn't say dead. He said extinct.\nClint Barton: He also said he killed somebody.\nMaria Hill: But there wasn't anyone else in the building.\nTony Stark: Yes there was. [Stark bring up the now destroyed 3D image of JARVIS' consciousness]\nBruce Banner: This is insane.\nSteve Rogers: JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.\nBruce Banner: No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage. [suddenly, Thor grabs hold of Stark by his throat and holds him up]\nClint Barton: Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.\nTony Stark: [to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy.\nThor': I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.\nSteve Rogers: Thor! The Legionnaire. [Thor lets go of Stark]\nThor: Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.\nNatasha Romanoff: The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.\nDr. Helen Cho: I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us? [Stark starts laughing, Banner subtly shakes his head at him to get him to stop]\nThor: You think this is funny?\nTony Stark: No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.\nThor: This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.\nTony Stark: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.\nBruce Banner: Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...\nTony Stark: Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.\nBruce Banner: Only when I've created a murder bot.\nTony Stark: We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?\nSteve Rogers: Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.\nTony Stark: Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?\nJames Rhodes: No, it's never come up.\nTony Stark: Saved New York?\nJames Rhodes: Never heard that.\nTony Stark: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?\nSteve Rogers: Together.\nTony Stark: We'll lose.\nSteve Rogers: Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller. [The twins meet with Ultron in an empty building]\nWanda Maximoff: Talk. And if you are wasting our time...\nUltron: Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair faced away from them] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.\nWanda Maximoff: Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself. [Ultron stands and faces them revealing his new body. Wanda briefly looks shocked]\nUltron: Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.\nWanda Maximoff: I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.\nUltron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.\nWanda Maximoff: Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?\nUltron: I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.\nWanda Maximoff: [referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are... All of these are...\nUltron: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...\nPietro Maximoff: Everyone's plan is not to kill them.\nUltron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.\nPietro Maximoff: I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.\nUltron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.\nPietro Maximoff: The records are not the picture.\nWanda Maximoff: Pietro.\nUltron: No, please.\nPietro Maximoff: We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...\nWanda Maximoff: Stark.\nPietro Maximoff: We were trapped two days.\nWanda Maximoff: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, \"This will set it off.\" We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.\nPietro Maximoff: I know what they are.\nUltron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside. [back at the Avengers headquarters]\nMaria Hill: He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.\nSteve Rogers: Fatalities?\nMaria Hill: Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.\nSteve Rogers: Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.\nMaria Hill: Not anymore. [she hands Steve a tablet showing photo of Strucker's dead body with the word PEACE written in blood on the wall next to him]\nClint Barton: [Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]\nSteve Rogers: Barton, we might have something.\nClint Barton: Gotta go.\nSteve Rogers: Who was that?\nClint Barton: Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body]\nTony Stark: What's this?\nSteve Rogers: A message. Ultron killed Strucker.\nTony Stark: And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.\nNatasha Romanoff: This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?\nSteve Rogers: Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.\nNatasha Romanoff: Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.\nTony Stark: Not everything. [the team go through the physical files they have on Strucker]\nSteve Rogers: Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.\nBruce Banner: Well, these people are all horrible.\nTony Stark: Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very \"Ahab.\"\nThor: [Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] This.\nTony Stark: Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...\nThor: No, those are tattoos, this is a brand. [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer]\nBruce Banner: Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.\nSteve Rogers: What dialect?\nBruce Banner: Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.\nTony Stark: If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...\nSteve Rogers: I thought your father said he got the last of it?\nBruce Banner: I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda? [looking at Steve's shield]\nTony Stark: The strongest metal on earth.\nSteve Rogers: [to Stark] Where is this guy now? [Salvage Yard, African Coast; talking on the phone in his office]\nUlysses Klaue: Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard and the twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a plate from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.\nWanda Maximoff: Everybody's afraid of something.\nUlysses Klaue: Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks back, expecting to be attacked] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge. [suddenly Ultron breaks through the glass window and knocks down Klaue]\nUltron: There is no \"man\" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.\nUlysses Klaue: You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions. [Ultron chuckles and remotely puts money in Klaue's bank account]\nUltron: Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, \"Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which.\"\nUlysses Klaue: Stark.\nUltron: What?\nUlysses Klaue: Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.\nUltron: What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing! [suddenly he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! he's a sickness! [Stark appears in his Iron Man suit]\nTony Stark: Ahh, Junior. [Thor and Steve are behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart.\nUltron: If I have to.\nThor: We don't have to break anything.\nUltron: Clearly you've never made an omelet.\nTony Stark: He beat me by one second.\nPietro Maximoff: Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?\nTony Stark: This was never my life.\nSteve Rogers: [to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.\nWanda Maximoff: Oh, we will.\nSteve Rogers: I know you've suffered.\nUltron: Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...\nThor: If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.\nUltron: I think you're confusing peace with quiet.\nTony Stark: Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?\nUltron: I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan! [suddenly the Iron Legions attack Stark, Steve and Thor; Stark then attacks Ultron] [as Ultron, his Iron Legions and the twins are fighting with Stark, Steve and Thor]\nUlysses Klaue: Shoot them!\nKlaue's Mercenary: Which ones?\nUlysses Klaue: All of them!\nKlaue's Mercenary: [to his men] Move, move, move! [the rest of the team, including Natasha and Barton now battle it out with the Iron Legions, Klaue's men and the twins as Stark fight with Ultron]\nSteve Rogers: [after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!\nUltron: [to Wanda] It's time for some mind games. [Banner hears the commotion as he waits in the Quinjet]\nBruce Banner: Guys, is this a Code Green? [Wanda uses her power on Thor then Steve comes up to him]\nSteve Rogers: Thor! Status?\nThor: The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [just then Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard] [Wanda then uses her power on Steve and Natasha]\nUltron: This is going very well. [Wanda tries to sneak up behind Barton, but he quickly turns and puts an electric arrow on her forehead]\nClint Barton: I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys? [Natasha sees herself in the facility where young girls are being taught ballet]\nBallet Instructor: [to the students] Again.\nNatasha Romanoff: You'll break them.\nMadame B: Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.\nNatasha Romanoff: What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin]\nMadame B: You never fail. [Steve sees himself in a 1940's dance hall when Peggy Carter comes up to him]\nPeggy Carter: Are you ready for our dance? [back to Thor's vision in Asgard, he spots someone walking in a black cloak when Heimdall comes up to him his eyes blind and unseeing]\nHeimdall: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?\nThor: Heimdall, your eyes?!\nHeimdall: Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to strangle Thor] [back to Steve's vision with Peggy in the dance hall]\nPeggy Carter: The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty, then Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]\nThor: I can still save you.\nHeimdall: We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things] [back to Natasha's vision where is she being trained by Madame B to be an assassin]\nMadame B: Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.\nNatasha Romanoff: I have no place in the world.\nMadame B: Exactly. [as Wanda suffers in pain from the electric arrow Barton had hit her with]\nPietro Maximoff: What can I do?\nWanda Maximoff: Ah, it hurts.\nPietro Maximoff: I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.\nWanda Maximoff: No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one. [after Stark corners Ultron]\nUltron: Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.\nTony Stark: And you're not going anywhere.\nUltron: Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner. [Stark angrily shoots Ultron and flies off to find Banner who's turned in to the Hulk and ready to wreak havoc on the nearest city]\nTony Stark: News or footage, keyword: Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. [Barton is sat with Natasha who's still stuck in her vision]\nClint Barton: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.\nTony Stark: I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner. [Hulk roars in anger] Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting and throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's armor arms VERONICA sends in a new Hulkbuster armor arm and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him] [to the people in the building] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold] [with Banner back to normal and everybody back on the Quinjet]\nMaria Hill: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.\nTony Stark: Stark Relief Foundation?\nMaria Hill: Already on the scene. How's the team?\nTony Stark: Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.\nMaria Hill: Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.\nTony Stark: So, run and hide?\nMaria Hill: Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.\nTony Stark: Neither do we. [he switches off the monitor showing Maria ending the call] [to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?\nClint Barton: No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.\nTony Stark: A few hours from where?\nClint Barton: A safe house. [the Quinjet lands outside a large farmhouse and they all walk towards the house]\nThor: What is this place?\nTony Stark: A safe house?\nClint Barton: Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home. [Barton's heavily pregnant wife, Laura, walks in from the kitchen]\nClint Barton: Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.\nLaura Barton: Hey.\nTony Stark: [Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.\nClint Barton: [introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura.\nLaura Barton: I know all your names. [they all look at her awkwardly]\nClint Barton: Ooh, incoming. [Barton's son Cooper and daughter Lila run in]\nBarton's Daughter: Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter]\nClint Barton: I see her! [kissing the top his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...\nTony Stark: [to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.\nClint Barton: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!\nLila Barton: Did you bring Auntie Nat?\nNatasha Romanoff: Why don't you hug her and find out? [Lila rushes towards Natasha who picks her up in her arms]\nSteve Rogers: Sorry for barging in on you.\nTony Stark: Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.\nClint Barton: Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.\nLaura Barton: Honey. Ah, I missed you.\nNatasha Romanoff: [touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?\nLaura Barton: She's\u2026Nathaniel. [Natasha bends towards Laura's pregnant stomach]\nNatasha Romanoff: Traitor. [the hallucinations brought on by Wanda continue to creep up in Thor's mind and he walks out of the house]\nSteve Rogers: Thor.\nThor: I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly out of there; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]\nPeggy Carter: We can go home. [Laura checks Barton's wound that Pietro had give him]\nClint Barton: See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?\nLaura Barton: If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up. [Barton laughs]\nClint Barton: Yeah, that's not gonna sell.\nLaura Barton: What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?\nClint Barton: Has what? [Laura laughs]\nLaura Barton: You are so cute.\nClint Barton: Nat and...and Banner?\nLaura Barton: I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.\nClint Barton: Oh. Okay.\nLaura Barton: It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.\nClint Barton: Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.\nLaura Barton: And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those \"Gods\"...\nClint Barton: You don't think they need me.\nLaura Barton: I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.\nClint Barton: Yeah. I guess they're my mess.\nLaura Barton: You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.\nClint Barton: Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]\nLaura Barton: I can feel the difference. [U-Gin Genetic Research Lab, Seoul, Korea - as Cho enters her lab she sees Ultron]\nUltron: Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.\nDr. Helen Cho: Do you expect a thank you note?\nUltron: I expect you to know why.\nDr. Helen Cho: The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] \"This is the next thing, Tony.\"\nUltron: This...is the next me.\nDr. Helen Cho: The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.\nUltron: It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho] [at Barton's house, Natasha and Banner are still experiencing the after effects of Wanda's hallucinations; Banner walks out of the bathroom and sees Natasha waiting outside]\nBruce Banner: I didn't realize you were waiting.\nNatasha Romanoff: I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.\nBruce Banner: They used up all the hot water.\nNatasha Romanoff: I should've joined you.\nBruce Banner: Missed our window.\nNatasha Romanoff: Did we?\nBruce Banner: The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.\nNatasha Romanoff: But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...\nBruce Banner: What did you dream?\nNatasha Romanoff: That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.\nBruce Banner: I think you're being hard on yourself.\nNatasha Romanoff: Here I was hoping that was your job. [she leans close into him]\nBruce Banner: What are you doing?\nNatasha Romanoff: I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.\nBruce Banner: Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her]\nNatasha Romanoff: I want you to understand that I'm...\nBruce Banner: Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?\nNatasha Romanoff: You're not a threat to me.\nBruce Banner: You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.\nNatasha Romanoff: Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?\nBruce Banner: What, so we disappear? [Steve and Stark are chopping wood outside Barton's house]\nTony Stark: Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?\nSteve Rogers: Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.\nTony Stark: Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.\nSteve Rogers: \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes.\" Pulled us apart like cotton candy.\nTony Stark: Seems like you walked away all right.\nSteve Rogers: Is that a problem?\nTony Stark: I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.\nSteve Rogers: Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.\nTony Stark: You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?\nSteve Rogers: Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.\nTony Stark: Banner and I were doing research.\nSteve Rogers: That would affect the team.\nTony Stark: That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the \"why\" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?\nSteve Rogers: Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time. [Laura interrupts them]\nLaura Barton: I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...\nTony Stark: Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? [suddenly Fury shows up from the other end of the barn]\nNick Fury: Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.\nTony Stark: Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?\nNick Fury: Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.\nTony Stark: Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?\nNick Fury: Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.\nTony Stark: You're not the director of me.\nNick Fury: I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.\nTony Stark: And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.\nNick Fury: The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.\nTony Stark: I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.\nNick Fury: You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.\nTony Stark: I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.\nNick Fury: The worst part is that you didn't. [Royal Holloway, University of London - Thor, dressed in casual clothes, waits for Selvig as he leaves the building]\nErik Selvig: I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.\nThor: I need your help.\nThor: It's dangerous.\nErik Selvig: I'd be disappointed if it wasn't. [back at Barton's house Fury meets with the rest of the team]\nNick Fury: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.\nSteve Rogers: What about Ultron himself?\nNick Fury: Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.\nTony Stark: He still going after launch codes?\nNick Fury: Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.\nTony Stark: I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.\nNick Fury: Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.\nSteve Rogers: NEXUS?\nBruce Banner: It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.\nClint Barton: So what'd they say?\nNick Fury: He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.\nTony Stark: By whom?\nNick Fury: Parties unknown.\nNatasha Romanoff: Do we have an ally?\nNick Fury: Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.\nTony Stark: I might need to visit Oslo, find our \"unknown.\"\nNatasha Romanoff: Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.\nNick Fury: I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.\nNatasha Romanoff: Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.\nSteve Rogers: You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]\nNick Fury: So what does he want?\nSteve Rogers: To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.\nTony Stark: Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.\nNatasha Romanoff: When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.\nBruce Banner: They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.\nNick Fury: How?\nBruce Banner: Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho? [in Korea, Cho is creating a new body for Ultron]\nDr. Helen Cho: It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...\nUltron: The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron breaks open the scepter's blue gem and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body] [back at the Barton's farm]\nSteve Rogers: I'll take Natasha and Clint.\nTony Stark: Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.\nSteve Rogers: If Ultron is really building a body...\nTony Stark: He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.\nSteve Rogers: You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.\nNick Fury: I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?\nTony Stark: She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?\nNick Fury: I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.\nClint Barton: I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.\nLaura Barton: Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.\nClint Barton: No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet] [Thor and Selvig enter into a cave]\nErik Selvig: This is it. The Water of Sight.\nThor: In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.\nErik Selvig: The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well. [NEXUS Internet Hub, Oslo, Norway]\nTony Stark: A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.\nWorld Hub Tech: How do you find it?\nTony Stark: Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he conducts his search] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me. [back at the cave with Thor and Selvig, Thor is now in the water and goes back in his vision with Heimdall]\nHeimdall: Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body]\nErik Selvig: Thor!\nUltron: [he sees visions of Ultron] Extinction. [then he sees the creation of the Infinity Stones] [in Korea with Cho and Ultron]\nDr. Helen Cho: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.\nWanda Maximoff: I can read him. He is dreaming.\nDr. Helen Cho: I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...\nUltron: How soon? I'm not being pushy.\nDr. Helen Cho: We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is... [Wanda, reading Ultron's mind, sees a vision of global annihilation, which horrifies her and she screams]\nWanda Maximoff: How could you?\nUltron: How could I what?\nWanda Maximoff: You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.\nUltron: It will be better.\nWanda Maximoff: When everyone is dead.\nUltron: That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.\nPietro Maximoff: And if they don't?\nUltron: Ask Noah.\nWanda Maximoff: You're a madman.\nUltron: There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.\nPietro Maximoff: And who decides who's weak? [as Ultron is distracted Wanda breaks the scepter's hold off of Cho]\nUltron: Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move. [Cho cancels the upload to Ultron's consciousness]\nDr. Helen Cho: That's not a problem. [Ultron blasts Cho, Wanda and Pietro run off]\nUltron: Ah, wait, guys!. [he blasts Cho's technicians] They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time. [unplugs himself from the Cradle]\nSteve Rogers: [Steve is on U-Gin Genetic Research Lab roof; to the others] Two minutes. Stay close. [inside the lab Steve finds Cho wounded] Dr. Cho!\nDr. Helen Cho: He's uploading himself into the body.\nSteve Rogers: Where?\nDr. Helen Cho: The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.\nSteve Rogers: First I have to find it.\nDr. Helen Cho: Go.\nSteve Rogers: [on the Quinjet, listening to Steve on the radio comms] Did you guys copy that?\nClint Barton: We did.\nNatasha Romanoff: I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.\nClint Barton: [noticing a truck leaving the lab] There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.\nSteve Rogers: Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. [Steve jumps onto the roof of the truck]\nUltron: No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!\nSteve Rogers: [Ultron blasts the truck door as Steve tries to enter] Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.\nClint Barton: You're not a match for him, Cap.\nSteve Rogers: Thanks, Barton. [Ultron blasts Steve as he tries to enter the truck, but Steve manages to get back onto the truck's roof]\nUltron: You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.\nSteve Rogers: I wouldn't call it a comfort. [Steve tries to fight with Ultron]\nUltron: Stop it! [he throws Steve shield aside and blasts him]\nClint Barton: [to Natasha] We got a window. Four, three...give 'em hell. [Natasha drops out of the Quinjet on a bike and rides towards the truck and picks up Steve's shield]\nNatasha Romanoff: I'm always picking up after you boys.\nClint Barton: They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.\nNatasha Romanoff: Which way?\nClint Barton: Hard right... Now. [Natasha heads over the truck, she throws Steve back his shield and he uses it to knock off Ultron from him]\nNatasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians on the pavement as she chases after the truck on her bike] Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through! [Steve continues his battle with Ultron on the truck]\nSteve Rogers: Come on!\nNatasha Romanoff: Clint, can you draw out the guards?\nClint Barton: Let's find out.\nNatasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians in her way] Beep beep! [Barton manages to draw out the Ultron sentries from the truck]\n[Steve later tackles Ultron into a train, the Ultron Sentries leave Barton and return to Ultron]\nClint Barton: Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now.\nNatasha Romanoff: I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?\nSteve Rogers: [as he continues his battle with Ultron] What do you think I've been doing? [as Natasha enters the truck the Iron Legions head back, pick up the truck and lift off]\nClint Barton: The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.\nNatasha Romanoff: Negative. I am still in the truck.\nClint Barton: What the hell are you...?\nNatasha Romanoff: Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.\nClint Barton: How do you want me to take it?\nNatasha Romanoff: Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that. [Pietro and Wanda turn up on the train to help Steve fight with Ultron]\nUltron: Please. Don't do this.\nWanda Maximoff: What choice do we have? [Ultron flies off]\nClint Barton: Nat, we gotta go. [Nat drops the cradle into the Quinjet but her foot gets caught by Ultron and she's pulled away]\nClint Barton: Nat! Cap, you see Nat?\nSteve Rogers: If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!\nClint Barton: Do you have eyes on Nat?\nSteve Rogers: Go! [reluctantly Barton takes off in the Quinjet; back on the train to the twins] Civilians in our path. [Pietro speeds off; to Wanda] Can you stop this thing? [as Pietro picks up civilians out of the way of the train Wanda uses her powers and stops the train] [after stopping the train Wanda goes over to an out of breath Pietro]\nPietro Maximoff: I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.\nSteve Rogers: I'm very tempted not to give you one.\nWanda Maximoff: The Cradle, did you get it?\nSteve Rogers: Stark will take care of it.\nWanda Maximoff: No, he won't.\nSteve Rogers: You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.\nWanda Maximoff: He will do anything to make things right.\nSteve Rogers: Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?\nWanda Maximoff: Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that? [after Barton has taken the Cradle to Stark and Banner]\nBruce Banner: Anything on Nat?\nTony Stark: Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.\nClint Barton: This is sealed tight.\nBruce Banner: We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.\nTony Stark: Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?\nClint Barton: There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton goes off]\nBruce Banner: I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.\nTony Stark: Yeah, about that. [Banner looks at Stark]\nBruce Banner: No.\nTony Stark: You have to trust me.\nBruce Banner: Kinda don't.\nTony Stark: Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up Jarvis's consciousness]\nJARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.\nTony Stark: Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.\nBruce Banner: So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?\nTony Stark: No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.\nBruce Banner: And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?\nTony Stark: JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.\nJARVIS: I believe it's worth a go.\nBruce Banner: No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.\nTony Stark: I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.\nUltron: [as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, \"What doesn't kill me\u2026[bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] \"\u2026just makes me stronger.\" [locks Natasha in a cell] [Barton gets a Morse code message from Natasha which he's able to detect her location, at the same time Stark and Banner are experimenting on the synthetic body]\nTony Stark: This framework is not compatible.\nBruce Banner: The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes. [Steve and the twins turn up at the lab]\nSteve Rogers: I'm gonna say this once.\nTony Stark: How about \"nonce\"?\nSteve Rogers: Shut it down!\nTony Stark: Nope, not gonna happen.\nSteve Rogers: You don't know what you're doing.\nBruce Banner: And you do? She's not in your head?\nWanda Maximoff: I know you're angry.\nBruce Banner: Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.\nSteve Rogers: Banner, after everything that's happened...\nTony Stark: That's nothing compared to what's coming!\nWanda Maximoff: You don't know what's in there!\nSteve Rogers: This isn't a game...\nWanda Maximoff: The creature...! [Pietro uses his speed to destroy the lab equipment]\nPietro Maximoff: No, no. Go on. You were saying? [suddenly Barton shoots a bullet below caused the glass Pietro is standing to stand to smash and he falls through]\nWanda Maximoff: Pietro!\nClint Barton: What? You didn't see that coming?\nBruce Banner: [to Wanda] Go ahead, piss me off. [just then Thor enters and pounds the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the body who has JARVIS' voice and has become the Vision]\nVision: I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you.\nSteve Rogers: Thor, you helped create this?\nThor: I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head]\nBruce Banner: What, the gem?\nThor: It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.\nSteve Rogers: Then why would you bring it to...\nThor: Because Stark is right.\nBruce Banner: Oh, it's definitely the end times.\nThor: The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.\nVision: Not alone.\nSteve Rogers: Why does your \"vision\" sound like JARVIS?\nTony Stark: We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.\nSteve Rogers: I think I've had my fill of new.\nVision: You think I'm a child of Ultron?\nSteve Rogers: You're not?\nVision: I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.\nWanda Maximoff: I looked in your head and saw annihilation.\nVision: Look again.\nClint Barton: Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.\nThor: Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...\nSteve Rogers: Is it? Are you? On our side?\nVision: I don't think it's that simple.\nClint Barton: Well it better get real simple real soon.\nVision: I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.\nTony Stark: What's he waiting for?\nVision: You.\nBruce Banner: Where?\nClint Barton: Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.\nBruce Banner: If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...\nVision: What will you do? [he looks at them all realizing they will destroy him] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer and hands it to him, Vision walks off and everyone stares in shock]\nThor: Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.\nSteve Rogers: [to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need. [they all start getting ready to leave, Stark loads up FRIDAY into his Iron Man suit now that JARVIS is no longer available]\nFRIDAY: Good evening, boss.\nTony Stark: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.\nSteve Rogers: I got no plans tomorrow night.\nTony Stark: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.\nVision: [walks past] That's true, he hates you the most.\nSteve Rogers: Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out. [Pietro speeds into the Sokovian police station]\nPietro Maximoff: We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns, takes a shotgun and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses. [Wanda uses her mind powers on the people of Sokovia to get them to evacuate]\nSteve Rogers: All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.\nBruce Banner: [inside her cell Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!\nNatasha Romanoff: Bruce?\nBruce Banner: [he walks over to her cell] You alright?\nNatasha Romanoff: Yeah.\nBruce Banner: The team's in the city, it's about to light up.\nNatasha Romanoff: I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?\nBruce Banner: Yeah, I did. [holds up gun and blasts the cell door open]\nNatasha Romanoff: So what's our play?\nBruce Banner: I'm here to get you to safety.\nNatasha Romanoff: Job's not finished.\nBruce Banner: We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.\nNatasha Romanoff: So we just disappear? [as the city is being evacuated]\nFRIDAY: Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]\nUltron: Come to confess your sins?\nTony Stark: I don't know, how much time you got?\nUltron: More than you.\nTony Stark: Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...\nUltron: You're stalling to protect the people.\nTony Stark: Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?\nUltron: I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [suddenly the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?\nFRIDAY: There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.\nUltron: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time. [Ultron's army of robots start attacking the city as everyone is evacuating]\nSteve Rogers: Go!\nWanda Maximoff: Get off the bridge! Run! [Vision then finds Ultron]\nVision: Ultron.\nUltron: My Vision. They really did take everything from me.\nVision: You set the terms, you can change them.\nUltron: Alright. [they start battling it out]\nTony Stark: FRIDAY! The Vision?\nFRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.\nUltron: [to the Vision] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core and the earth around Sokovia starts to shake and break]\nTony Stark: FRIDAY?\nFRIDAY: Sokovia's going for a ride. [as Sokovia is being destroyed]\nUltron: Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal. [as the earth is shaking falling in around them]\nBruce Banner: We gotta move.\nNatasha Romanoff: You're not going to turn green?\nBruce Banner: I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.\nNatasha Romanoff: I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]\nFRIDAY: The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.\nTony Stark: If it drops?\nFRIDAY: Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, Tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment]\nTony Stark: Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building]\nFRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.\nTony Stark: Cap, you got incoming.\nSteve Rogers: Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off. [Barton gets Wanda out of the way and into a building as Ultron's robots attach the city]\nClint Barton: Go, go, move!\nWanda Maximoff: How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down]\nClint Barton: Hey, hey, you okay?\nWanda Maximoff: This is all our fault.\nClint Barton: Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting his arrows at the robots]\nSteve Rogers: [to the woman Thor threw over to Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety]\nUltron: You can't save them all. You'll never... [he throws off one of the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge]\nSteve Rogers: You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of the woman's car he was saving] What, were you napping?\nUltron: [as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me. [as Barton is fighting off the robots Wanda suddenly comes out of the building and starts to use her powers on the robots to destroy them]\nClint Barton: Alright, we're all clear here.\nSteve Rogers: We are not clear! We are very not clear!\nClint Barton: Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]\nPietro Maximoff: Keep up old man! [Barton holds his arrow to aim it at Pietro]\nClint Barton: Nobody would know. Nobody. \"The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already.\"\nSteve Rogers: [as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff! [he throws his shield at her so she can use it to protect herself from the attacking robot]\nNatasha Romanoff: Thanks. [back to Stark]\nFRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.\nTony Stark: The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...\nFRIDAY: It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.\nTony Stark: Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.\nFRIDAY: That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.\nSteve Rogers: The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?\nTony Stark: Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.\nSteve Rogers: I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.\nTony Stark: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.\nNatasha Romanoff: Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...\nSteve Rogers: Not 'til everyone's safe.\nNatasha Romanoff: Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.\n Steve Rogers: I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.\nNatasha Romanoff: I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?\nNick Fury: [voice] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [just then the Helicarrier show up] [inside the Helicarrier] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.\nSteve Rogers: Fury, you son of a bitch.\nNick Fury: Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?\nMaria Hill: Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.\nSpecialist Cameron Klein: Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out. [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards the them]\nPietro Maximoff: This is SHIELD?\nSteve Rogers: This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.\nPietro Maximoff: This is not so bad.\nSteve Rogers: Let's load 'em up.\nMaria Hill: Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.\nNick Fury: Show 'em what we got.\nMaria Hill: You're up. [Rhodes shows up in his War Machine suit and blasts one of the robots]\nJames Rhodes: Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.\nTony Stark: Yep. If you live to tell it.\nJames Rhodes: You think I can't hold my own?\nTony Stark: We get through this, I'll hold your own.\nJames Rhodes: You had to make it weird.\nClint Barton: [as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!\nSpecialist Cameron Klein: Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.\nMaria Hill: Incoming! [one of the robots flies in and crashes inside the Helicarrier]\nSpecialist Cameron Klein: Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]\nUltron: [as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.\nThor: I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron, Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]\nVision: It's terribly well balanced.\nThor: Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.\nTony Stark: I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.\nFRIDAY: Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.\nTony Stark: Thor, I got a plan!\nThor: We're out of time. They're coming for the core.\nTony Stark: Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.\nJames Rhodes: On it.\nTony Stark: Avengers, time to work for a living.\nPietro Maximoff: [the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision] You good?\nWanda Maximoff: Yeah.\nTony Stark: Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing \"hide the zucchini.\"\nNatasha Romanoff: Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?\nTony Stark: [points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. [Ultron shows up]\nThor: Is that the best you can do? [Ultron summons his army of robots to join him]\nSteve Rogers: You had to ask.\nUltron: This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?\nTony Stark: Well, like the old man said. Together. [they all fight off Ultron's attacking robots]\nUltron: You know, with the benefit of hindsight.... [suddenly Hulk knocks him far away and the robots start to retreat]\nThor: They'll try to leave the city.\nTony Stark: We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!\nJames Rhodes: I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ... [just then Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?\nSteve Rogers: We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.\nClint Barton: What about the core?\nWanda Maximoff: I'll protect it. It's my job.\nWanda Maximoff: [Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats.\nPietro Maximoff: I'm not going to leave you here.\nWanda Maximoff: I can handle this. [just then she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.\nPietro Maximoff: Hmm.\nWanda Maximoff: You understand?\nPietro Maximoff: You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you. [Wanda chuckles]\nWanda Maximoff: Go.\nFRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below opt...\nTony Stark: Re-route everything. We get one shot at this. [Barton and Natasha are making their way to the lifeboats]\nClint Barton: I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?\nNatasha Romanoff: You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.\nClint Barton: No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.\nNatasha Romanoff: So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low. [Barton gets onto one of the lifeboats, but notices a woman calling out for her brother]\nZrinka: Costel? We were in the market. Costel?! [Barton runs off to find the boy]\nTony Stark: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.\nThor: [referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats] Is this the last of them?\nSteve Rogers: Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.\nTony Stark: You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.\nThor: Maybe not. [just as Natasha tries to calm Hulk down to get him back to being Banner Ultron flies in with a jet and starts shooting at them]\nUltron: [sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them but Pietro intervenes and takes the shots to save them]\nPietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair] [Hulk drops Natasha off onto the Helicarrier and then jumps onto the jet Ultron is on]\nUltron: Oh, for God's sake! [Hulk knocks Ultron out of the jet and he crashes inside a train; at the same time Barton delivers Costel safely to his sister onto the lifeboat, a man goes over to help him with his wound]\nClint Barton: No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day. [Wanda then finds the Ultron]\nUltron: Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.\nWanda Maximoff: I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that. [Stark fires a powerful blast to the core underneath the floating city]\nTony Stark: Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with as the city is being destroyed] Now! [Thor uses his hammer to hit the Vibranium core in the church, destroying the core and the floating city]\nNatasha Romanoff: [to Hulk as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t... [Hulk turns off Nat's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination, at the same time Vision finds Ultron]\nVision: You're afraid.\nUltron: Of you?\nVision: Of death. You're the last one.\nUltron: You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.\nVision: I suppose we're both disappointments. [Ultron chuckles]\nUltron: I suppose we are.\nVision: Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.\nUltron: They're doomed.\nVision: Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.\nUltron: You're unbearably naive.\nVision: Well, I was born yesterday. [as Ultron goes to attack him Vision uses the infinity stone in his head to destroy him]\nLaura Barton: [we see Barton returning to his family on the farm, then we see Stark driving to the new Avengers facility in upstate New York; Natasha looks at Barton's new baby on her phone] Say hi to Auntie Nat. [Natasha sees the baby has been named Nathaniel Pietro Barton]\nNatasha Romanoff: Fat.\nNick Fury: One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.\nNatasha Romanoff: Right.\nNick Fury: Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.\nNatasha Romanoff: \"Wish you were here.\" You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?\nNick Fury: You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.\nNatasha Romanoff: Nothing lasts forever.\nNick Fury: Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.\nSteve Rogers: The rules have changed.\nTony Stark: We're dealing with something new.\nSteve Rogers: Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.\nTony Stark: A machine.\nSteve Rogers: So it doesn't count.\nTony Stark: No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.\nSteve Rogers: Right. Different rules for us.\nTony Stark: Nice guy, but artificial.\nSteve Rogers: Thank you.\nThor: If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.\nSteve Rogers: But if you put the hammer in an elevator...\nTony Stark: It would still go up.\nSteve Rogers: Elevator's not worthy.\nThor: I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.\nTony Stark: Well, not if you don't leave.\nThor: I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...\nTony Stark: Triple Yahtzee?\nSteve Rogers: You think you can find out what's coming?\n Thor: I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. [Thor returns to Asgard which burns a circle in the grass he was standing on]\nTony Stark: That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. [as they walk over towards Stark's car]\nSteve Rogers: I will miss you, Tony.\nTony Stark: Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.\nSteve Rogers: The simple life.\nTony Stark: You'll get there one day.\nSteve Rogers: I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. [Stark turns to get into his car]\nTony Stark: You alright?\nSteve Rogers: I'm home. [last lines; Steve finds Natasha standing alone] You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.\nNatasha Romanoff: I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?\nSteve Rogers: Well, we're not the '27 Yankees. [hands Natasha a tablet]\nNatasha Romanoff: We've got some hitters.\nSteve Rogers: They're good. They're not a team.\nNatasha Romanoff: Let's beat 'em into shape. [they gather Rhodes in his War Machine suit, Sam in his Falcon suit, Wanda in a new suit, and Vision]\nSteve Rogers: Avengers...!\n\n[mid-credits scene; we see the Infinity Gauntlet without any of the Stones, dissatisfied Thanos opens a vault and puts on The Infinty Gauntlet, revealing himself]\nThanos: Fine, I'll do it myself.\n[End of Avengers: Age of Ultron]\n\n\n\n"

We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.\u00a0[The voice becomes more desperate and pleading] Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft.\u00a0I repeat, this is not a warcraft!\n[Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walks among the bodies of dead Asgardians. Heimdall, badly wounded, reaches out as if he would stop Maw as he passes, but lacks the strength. Maw steps over them with no mind as he speaks, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor.]\nEbony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip\u00a0toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... [Corvus Glaive stabs one of the lingering Asgardians] for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.\n[Loki stands with the Black Order. He watches Thanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette.]\nThanos: [Looking out the large window we saw at the end of Thor: Ragnarok] I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right...\u00a0yet to fail, nonetheless. [Lifts Thor by the neck of his breastplate. Thor struggles feebly.] It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.\n[Thanos holds up his hand to reveal the Infinity Gauntlet, which already hosts the violet Power Stone.]\nThor: [Now being held by Thanos with one huge hand wrapping around his head; blood drools from his mouth] You talk too much.\nThanos: [To Loki] The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.\n[The Black Order heft their weapons or smirks, as appropriate.]\nLoki: Oh, I do. Kill away!\n[Thanos' face expresses surprise briefly before presses the gauntlet to Thor's left temple. The Power Stone glows brightly. Thor screams hoarsely.]\nLoki: [Starts losing his cool demeanor almost immediately as Thor suffers, and breaks after only a few moments] ALL RIGHT, STOP!\nThor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.\n[Loki glances at Thor like he knows something he doesn't. He lifts his right hand into the air and the Tesseract reveals itself.]\nThor: You really are the worst brother.\nLoki: [While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.\nThanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.\nLoki: Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... we have a Hulk.\n[Thanos looks to his right just as a green and very angry mass slams into him. Loki dives for Thor, pulling both of them out of the way as the Tesseract skitters across the floor, and the Hulk charges Thanos. The Hulk pummels Thanos, forcing him backwards and shoving him into the wall of the ship. Maw stops Cull Obsidian from interfering.]\nEbony Maw: Let him have his fun.\n[Thanos pries the Hulk's hands away; an expression of surprise and fear crosses his green face. After several hard blows, Thanos picks up the Hulk and slams him to the deck, defeated. Thor slams a metal bar across Thanos' back to no avail, is kicked across the deck by Thanos and is promptly bound in metal debris by Ebony Maw to keep him from interfering further.]\nHeimdall: [Prays] Allfathers\u2026 let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.\n[Heimdall summons the Bifrost, which carries the Hulk away; he meets Thor's eye.]\nThanos: That was a mistake.\n[Thanos borrows Corvus's glaive and stabs Heimdall through the heart, twisting the blade in the wound.]\nThor: NO!!! [After Thanos kills Heimdall] You're going to die for that!\nEbony Maw: [Shuts Thor's mouth with his telekinesis] Shh.\nEbony Maw: [Kneels before Thanos, offering up the Tesseract] My humble personage\u2026 bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two\u00a0Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.\n[Thanos crushes the Tesseract, revealing the blue Space Stone. He blows some of the fractals away, fingering the Stone between his thumb and index, before placing it on the gauntlet, and is momentarily rocked by the surge of energy that pulses as the stone seats in its setting.]\nThanos: There are two\u00a0more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.\nProxima Midnight: [Kneeling] Father, we will not fail you.\nLoki: [Emerging from behind the Black Order] [cheerfully] If I might interject\u2026 if you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.\nThanos: [Unimpressed] If you consider failure experience.\nLoki: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard... [looks significantly at Thor] Odinson... the rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.\n[Thor squints and notices a dagger materialize in Loki's hand. Loki braces himself, thrusts upward with lightning speed and attempts to stab Thanos, but is frozen in place by the Space Stone's power before the point could strike home.]\nThanos: \"Undying.\" You should choose your words more carefully.\n[Thanos twists the dagger out of Loki's hand with his right hand, then takes hold of Loki's neck with the gauntlet and lifts him to eye level. Loki struggles, kicking, as his throat is squeezed. He makes eye contact with Thor before he increases his force on Loki's neck.]\nLoki: [Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You will... never be... a god. [Thanos crushes Loki's neck, killing him.]\nThanos: [Walks over and drops Loki's body in front of Thor.] No resurrections this time.\n[Thanos raises the gauntlet, sends violet Power fire through the remains of the Statesman, and uses the Space Stone to teleport away with the Black Order.]\nThor: No\u2026 Loki\u2026.\n[Thor is released from his bonds. He crawls over to Loki's body -- which, unlike in The Dark World, has not returned to its Jotun form -- and lays his head down on Loki's chest, shedding tears for all that he has lost. The ship explodes.]\n[The Bifrost continues its journey, bringing the Hulk across space to Earth.]\n[Sanctum Sanctorum, New York City]\n[Doctor Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, proceeds down the main steps of the Sanctum with Wong.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Dressed in casual American clothes.] Seriously? You don't have any money?\nWong: [Dressed as Wong is always dressed.] Attachment to the material is detachment from\u00a0the spiritual.\nDr. Stephen Strange: I'll tell the guys at the deli. [Wryly] Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on\u00a0rye.\nWong: Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have\u00a0200.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Dollars?\nWong: Rupees.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Which is?\nWong: Uh,\u00a0buck and a half.\nDr. Stephen Strange: What do you want?\nWong: I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.\n[Bruce crash-lands through the Sanctum stairs. The Cloak of Levitation swirls around Strange's shoulders immediately.]\nBruce Banner: Thanos is coming. He's coming...\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Sharing a look with Wong, and now fully in his mage attire] Who?\n[Title Screen: Avengers: Infinity War]\n[Public Park, New York City, day. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts walk on having a conversation.]\nTony Stark: Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.\nPepper Potts: [Laughing slightly and talking over him] You're totally\u00a0rambling.\nTony Stark: [Also talking over her] No, I'm not.\nPepper Potts: Lost me.\nTony Stark: Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?\nPepper Potts: Yeah.\nTony Stark: Okay, and then you're like, 'Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?', 'Oh! Someone's watching,' ''m gonna go in my pants.'\nPepper Potts: Right. And then you wake up, and\u00a0in real life you actually have to pee.\nTony Stark: Yes.\nPepper Potts: Yeah. Everybody has that.\nTony Stark: Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?\nPepper Potts: [Nodding in understanding] Right.\nTony Stark: Morgan! Morgan.\nPepper Potts: So you woke up, and thought that we were...\nTony Stark: Expecting.\nPepper Potts: Yeah.\nTony Stark: [Becoming excited] Yes?\nPepper Potts: [Shaking her head] No.\nTony Stark: I had a dream about it. It was so real.\nPepper Potts: If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.\n[Pepper unties his jacket sleeves and taps Tony's chest attachment.]\nTony Stark: I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.\nPepper Potts: It's not helping your case, OK?\nTony Stark: No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-\nPepper Potts: [Insistently] You don't need that.\nTony Stark: I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future usses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...\nPepper Potts: Shirts?\nTony Stark: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.\nPepper Potts: You should have shirts in your closet.\nTony Stark: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna\u00a0have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.\nPepper Potts: Yes.\nTony Stark: I will. [Tony kisses Pepper.]\n[Doctor Strange comes through a portal.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.\n[Tony and Pepper are understandably shocked.]\nTony Stark: I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?\nDr. Stephen Strange:We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.\nTony Stark: And who's \"we\"?\nBruce Banner: [Emerges from behind Doctor Strange] Hey, Tony.\nTony Stark: [Looking surprised] Bruce.\nBruce Banner: Pepper.\nPepper Potts: Hi.\nTony Stark: You okay?\n[Bruce gives Tony a desperate hug, not answering. After everything he has been through, we understand.]\n[Back at the Sanctum Sanctorum.]\nWong: [Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones.] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom!\u00a0The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Each Stone lights up as Dr. Strange names them.] Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.\n[Dr. Strange opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone emitting emerald light.]\nTony Stark: [Very attentive] Tell me his name again.\nBruce Banner:\u00a0Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.\nTony Stark: [Speaking to himself] This is it... What's our timeline?\nBruce Banner: No telling.\u00a0He has the Power and Space Stones, that already\u00a0makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...\nDr. Stephen Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.\nTony Stark: [Leans against a cauldron, stretching like he's about to go for a run.] Did you seriously just say \"hitherto undreamt of\"?\nDr. Stephen Strange: Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?\nTony Stark: Is that what this is....\u00a0?\n[The Cloak of Levitation smacks Tony's arm, surprising him.]\nTony Stark: [Looking offended] [Straightening himself] I'm going to allow that.\u00a0If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?\nDr. Stephen Strange: No can do.\nWong:\u00a0We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.\nTony Stark:\u00a0And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so....\nDr. Stephen Strange: Stark Raving Hazelnuts.\nTony Stark: It's not bad.\nDr. Stephen Strange: A\u00a0bit chalky.\nWong: A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge is our favorite.\nBruce Banner: That's a thing?\nTony Stark: Whatever. Point is: things change.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.\nTony Stark: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Well, if we don't do our jobs.\nTony Stark: [Slightly condescending] What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Completely calm] Protecting your reality, douchebag.\n[You seriously can't tell who's sarcasm is better.]\nBruce Banner: Okay, guys, could we table\u00a0this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.\nTony Stark: [Awkwardly] Yeah, that's the... thing.\nBruce Banner: What do you mean?\nTony Stark: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.\nBruce Banner: What? Tony, you lost another super bot?\nTony Stark: I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Who could find Vision, then?\nTony Stark: [Quietly to himself] Shit. [To the other men in a normal tone] Probably Steve Rogers.\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Sighing in exasperation] Oh, great.\nTony Stark: Maybe. But... [Sighs]\nBruce Banner: [Missing the events of the Avengers' Civil War] Call him.\nTony Stark: It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?\nBruce Banner: No.\nTony Stark:\u00a0The Avengers broke up. We're toast.\nBruce Banner: [Rather surprised and slightly let-down] Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?\nTony Stark: Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.\nBruce Banner: [Almost pleading] Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.\n[Tony hesitates, before pulling out the cellular phone Steve mailed him, muttering 'flip phone'. It seems as though he brings it everywhere, always ready to call his lost friend. Before clicking \"Call\", he pauses, distracted by an unusual rumbling.]\nTony Stark: Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Looking up at his forelock fluttering] Not at the moment, no.\n[Tony looks at the Hulk-made opening\u00a0through\u00a0the ceiling and sees debris flying by outside. He exits the Sanctum through the front door and scans\u00a0the chaotic surroundings, the camera shaking around in this following long take to illustrate the chaos -- people running and screaming in alarm, traffic becoming impossibly tangled, a litter-filled wind like a nor'easter's. A woman falls nearly at his feet and he helps her up.]\nTony Stark: You okay?\n[The woman ignores him and runs away. A car crashes in on a pole behind Tony.]\nTony Stark: Help him! Wong, Doc.\nBruce Banner: Go! Got it!\nTony Stark: [Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?\nF.R.I.D.A.Y.: Not sure, I'm working on it.\nTony Stark: Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Bands of spells are readied around his forearms] Might wanna use it.\n[A mechanical hum grows louder as Tony approaches the intersection. As he turns the corner, he sees a huge\u00a0circular ship floating over Bleecker Street.]\n[On a school bus, the hairs on Peter Parker's arms stand up. He looks out the window and sees the ship.]\nPeter Parker:\u00a0[Tapping his best friend in the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.\nNed Leeds: [Turns around and sees the spaceship] Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!\n[Students scramble to the windows in the back to see the spaceship.]\n[Peter quickly slides on one of his Stark-made webshooters, and webs the emergency exit lever on the opposite side of the bus.]\nSchool Bus Driver, Stan Lee: What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?\n[Peter jumps out the window, clinging to the side of the bus and pulling on his mask before leaping over the side of the bridge, shooting a web-line and swinging free. He makes his way hastily towards the ship.]\nTony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y.,\u00a0evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y.: Will do.\n[Doctor Strange throws the Winds of Watoomb over Bleeker Street, and winks at Tony. The dust clears. Tony is begrudgingly amused for a split second.]\n[Then Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian exit the ship by transmat.]\nEbony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...\nTony Stark:\u00a0[Echoing the familiarly defiant 2008 Tony Stark] I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.\nEbony Maw: [Looks at Doctor Strange] Stonekeeper... [Gestures to Tony] Does this chattering animal speak for you?\nDr. Stephen Strange: Certainly not. I speak for myself. [Magical shields are readied with his fists, stepping forward.] But you\u2019re trespassing in this city and on this planet. [Wong emulates him.]\nTony Stark:\u00a0It means get lost, Squidward!\nEbony Maw: He exhausts me.\nCull Obsidian: [Two untranslated syllables]\nEbony Maw: Bring me the Stone.\nCull Obsidian: [Three untranslated syllables] [He drops his huge alien hammer and drags it along as he obeys his brethren.]\nTony Stark:\u00a0Banner, you want a piece?\nBruce Banner: No, not really, but when do I ever get what\u00a0I want?\nTony Stark: That's right.\n[Bruce attempts to release the Hulk. Instead of Hulk coming out easily, the most that turns green is Bruce's neck.]\nTony Stark: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.\nBruce Banner: I just... I need to concentrate here for one\u00a0second. Come on, come on, man.\nTony Stark: Where's your guy?\nBruce Banner: I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.\nTony Stark: There's no time for a thing.\nBruce Banner: I know.\nTony Stark: [Points at the approaching Obsidian] That's the thing right there. Let's go.\n[Bruce gives out a loud grunt, but fails to release the Hulk. Doctor Strange stares at Tony and Bruce in disbelief.]\nTony Stark: [Glances at Doctor Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.\nBruce Banner: Tony, I'm sorry. [Stammers] Either I can't or he won't--\nTony Stark: It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you.\nWong: I have him.\nBruce Banner: Damn it.\n[As Cull Obsidian approaches the team,\u00a0Tony dons his nanotech Iron Man suit in the space of three steps. He grows a shield on one arm to protect himself, then grows a set of blasters that easily throw the Dwarf back to Maw, who gestures and deflects his massive companion into some cars.]\nBruce Banner: Where'd that come from?\nTony Stark: It's nano-tech. You like it? A little someth--\n[Ebony Maw creates a spike of earth that throws Iron Man far up, and attacks the rest of the team with uprooted trees and other debris. Wong summons the Shield of the Seraphim.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us....\n[Doctor Strange teleports Bruce to a nearby\u00a0park along with half a taxi. Iron Man returns and joins the fight, pushing a car thrown by Maw back at him. Maw cuts it in half and lets the pieces fly past him, untouched.]\nTony Stark:\u00a0Gotta get that stone outta here, now.\nDr. Stephen Strange: It stays with me.\nTony Stark: Exactly. Bye.\n[Iron Man flies through Ebony Maw's obstacle course but is cut short by Cull Obsidian's hammer, sending him through a building and into the park at high speed, plowing into the ground and fetching up against a tree.]\nBruce Banner: [Rushing over to Iron Man] Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? Bad?\nTony Stark: Really, really good. Really good.\u00a0Do you plan on helping out?\nBruce Banner: I'm trying. He won't come out.\n[Cull Obsidian arrives at the park and throws his hammer at Bruce and Iron Man.] \nTony Stark: Hammer. [Pushes Bruce out of the way.]\n[Iron Man's energy beam deflects off Cull Obsidian's shield, slicing down trees. Bruce barely evades one.]\nBruce Banner: [Crawling out from under the branches. Desperate and confused] Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? [Starts slapping himself multiple times] Come out! Come out! Come out!\nHulk: [Half of Bruce's face becomes the Hulk.] Nooooooo! [Bruce falls back exhausted into his tree.]\nBruce Banner: What do you mean, \"no\"?!\n[Iron Man is knocked down by Obsidian, who is about to deliver a decisive blow, but the alien's hammer is easily caught\u00a0by Spider-Man.]\nPeter Parker: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?\nTony Stark: Kid, where'd you come from?\nPeter Parker: Field trip to MoMA.\n[Cull Obsidian grabs Spider-Man and throws him away.]\nPeter Parker: What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?\nTony Stark: He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.\n[Wong and Doctor Strange fight Maw. Maw lifts several bricks from the ground and turns them into sharp points. He sends them towards Wong and Doctor Strange. The two make portals and boomerang them back towards Maw. Maw moves a car to protect himself, but one spike still hits his head, creating a cut. Angered, Maw uses a broken fire hydrant's water stream to knock Wong back several meters, rendering him unconscious.]\n[Doctor Strange snaps a whip of magical energy to bind Maw's hands and yanks, but Maw flies forward with the pull and pins Doctor Strange upside-down against a building, using the bricks to trap the Sorcerer Supreme.]\nEbony Maw: Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.\n[Maw tries to grab the amulet holding the Time Stone but jerks back when it burns his hand.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.\nEbony Maw: [Vehemently] Then I'll take it off your corpse.\n[Maw pulls Doctor Strange away from the building and throws him to the ground. Doctor Strange starts the gestures to use the Eye of Agamotto, but utility cables first pin Doctor Strange's arms, interrupting the spell and closing the Eye, while another cable winds around his torso, then tightens around his throat.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.\nEbony Maw: You'll only wish you were dead. [Doctor Strange falls unconscious and to the ground; Maw raises a portion of street pavement to use as a carrier, but the Cloak of Levitation works its master loose of the cable spiral and flies Doctor Strange away.] NO!\nTony Stark: [Still fighting Cull Obsidian, as Doctor Strange passes through the park.] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.\nPeter Parker: On it!\n[Spider-Man chases Ebony Maw, floating speedily and upright on a small platform of burbling debris leaving a deep rut in the streets, who in turn chases the Cloak-driven Doctor Strange through Manhattan; Maw attacks him, throwing a Rocket Mortgage billboard at Spider-Man to be rid of him.]\nPeter Parker: [Untangles himself] Not cool!\n[Maw bends all the utility poles in the path of the fleeing Cloak, finally snagging the loyal garment and ripping it loose of its master. Spider-Man scoops up Doctor Strange before he hits the pavement, but before he can get away with the unconscious Doctor Strange, a cone of blue light starts pulling the mage inexorably upwards. Spider-Man grabs a light pole to anchor himself, but Maw uproots it, sending Doctor Strange, Cloak and teenager on their way to his ship.]\nPeter Parker: Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!\nTony Stark: Hang on, kid. [Cull Obsidian's hammer doubles as a claw, pinning Iron Man to the ground and shorting his suit. As Obsidian jumps towards Iron Man, blades ready to end this fight, he is sent through a portal instead. The alien turns and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closes it rapidly -- only Obsidian's severed hand makes it back to the park. Bruce kicks the hand away with a noise of disgust.]\nTony Stark: [Iron Man shakes himself free of the Dwarf's weapon, now powerless.] Wong, you're invited to my wedding. [Iron Man begins to fly towards the large ship] Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. [Iron Man's foot thrusters morph together into a single larger jet and increase his speed considerably.]\n[Ebony Maw walks towards the controls of the ship, Doctor Strange's unconscious body floating face-down behind him, and prepares to leave Earth's atmosphere.]\nTony Stark: [Still in pursuit of the ship and his protege.] Unlock 17-A. [A pod launches from the upstate Avengers headquarters and curves up to the accelerating circular ship.] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.\nPeter Parker: But you said save the wizard! [Spider-Man, gasping from lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!\nTony Stark: You're too high up. You're running out of air.\nPeter Parker: Yeah! That makes sense.\n[Peter passes out, free-falling, but not for long before the pod reaches him. It attaches itself to him, becoming the Iron Spider suit. Now being able to breathe, Spider-Man lands on a bottom part of the ship, standing up heroically.]\nPeter Parker: Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!\nTony Stark: Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y: Yep.\n[A large parachute extends from the new suit, snatching Spider-Man free of the ship's hull and him spiraling back to Earth.]\nPeter Parker: OH, COME ON!\n[Iron Man latches onto the hull and cuts a hole to board the ship, looking for wherever Strange and Ebony Maw went.]\nF.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.\nPepper Potts: [Sounding heavily worried] Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?\nTony Stark: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.\nPepper Potts: Why?\nTony Stark: [While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.\nPepper Potts: Tell me you're not on that ship.\nTony Stark: Yeah.\nPepper Potts: God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.\nTony Stark: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.\nPepper Potts: Come back here, Tony. I swear to God\u2026.\nTony Stark: Pep\u2026.\nPepper Potts: Come back here right now! Come back!\nF.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, we're losing her.\u00a0I'm going, too\u2026.\n[Spider-Man is revealed to have managed to shoot a web to the outside of the ship, foiling his parachute, and clambers inside a slowly-closing chamber.]\nPeter Parker: Oh\u00a0my God! [Looks at the rapidly-receding planet behind him] I should have stayed on the bus....\n[Ebony Maw, hands engaged in the ship's steering mechanism, accelerates into hyperspace.]\n[Meanwhile, back in New York]\n[Bruce finds Tony's flip-phone in the debris on the street and picks it up thoughtfully. Wong opens up a portal back to the Sanctum.]\nBruce Banner: Where you going?\nWong: The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?\nBruce Banner: [Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.\n[Wong nods in understanding and closes the portal, not to be seen again for the rest of the movie. Banner holds Steve Rogers' cell phone and makes a call.]\n[Screen title: SPACE]\n[Camera pans around a brightly colored planet with ice rings to the Benatar. The Guardians of the Galaxy are travelling to investigate a distress call to the tune of \"Rubberband Man\".]\nPeter Quill: [Chair-dancing to the song] Sing it, Drax!\n[Drax is snoring with his mouth open from his seat in front of Quill. Gamora lip-syncs with the song along with Quill.]\nRocket: [Yawns] Why are we doing this again?\nGamora: [Annoyed] It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.\nRocket: I get that, but why are we doing it?\nPeter Quill: 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese [Quill rubs his thumb against his other fingers] for our help.\nGamora: [Waves her index finger at Quill] Which isn't the point.\nPeter Quill: [Points back at Gamora] Which isn't the point... I mean\u2026 if he doesn't pony up\u2026.\nDrax: We'll take his ship.\nRocket: Exactly!\nPeter Quill: B-b-b-bingo!\n[Gamora looks up at Quill in concern. Quill returns her look and grimaces a \"don't worry about it\" expression at her.]\nMantis: [Reading her console] We are arriving.\nPeter Quill: All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. [Groot rolls his eyes as Mantis makes a snarl. Groot's handheld Terran-vintage video game beeps.] Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. [Game continues beeping] Groot.\nGroot: [In a mocking tone] I am Groot!\nPeter Quill: Whoa!\nRocket: Language!\nGamora: Hey!\nDrax: Wow.\nPeter Quill: You got some acorns on you, kid.\nRocket: Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!\n[Groot rolls his eyes.]\n[The Benatar decelerates, and Thanos' devastation suddenly covers the Guardians' field of view, revealing the distress signal to be the one from the Asgardian vessel at the beginning of the movie. Bodies are seen floating dead in space along with the pieces of the shredded ship.]\nMantis: What happened?\nRocket: Looks like we're not getting paid.\n[With a thump, Thor's body is plastered to the hull of the ship.]\nRocket: [Waving his hands] Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!\n[Thor\u2019s eye opens; all gasp.]\n[Cut to the Guardians settling the still-unconscious Thor onto an examination table.]\nPeter Quill: How the hell is this dude still alive?\nDrax: [Sounding awed] He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man.\nPeter Quill: [A little dented] I'm muscular.\nRocket: Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.\nPeter Quill: Yeah, right.\nDrax: It's true. You have gained a little weight\u2026. [Drax motions to his chin and belly.]\n[Gamora leaves Quill's side at Thor's right, and circles around the foot of the table.]\nPeter Quill: What? Gamora, do you think I'm\u2026\nMantis: He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.\nDrax: It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.\nPeter Quill: Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.\nRocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?\nGamora: [Reaches Drax's side and picks up Thor's left arm, stroking his triceps] It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.\nPeter Quill: [Snidely to Gamora] Stop massaging his muscles. [Gamora, annoyed, drops the arm with a thump; quietly to Mantis] Wake him up.\nMantis: [Places hand on Thor's forehead] Wake.\n[Thor awakens, sitting up violently and throwing himself off the table to stumble a few steps away, then turning to see his hosts all pointing their weapons of choice at him; Groot is still playing his game.]\nThor: Who the hell are you guys?\n[Cut to later as the Guardians stand around Thor eating soup.]\nGamora: The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre....\nDrax: Including my own.\nGamora: If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. [She snaps her fingers.]\nThor: You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.\nDrax: Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.\nThor: Your father killed my brother. [Thor stands and strides towards Gamora aggressively.]\nPeter Quill: Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. [Thor softens a bit.]\nThor: Families can be tough. [He claps a hand on Gamora's shoulder] Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.\n[Peter glares at Thor's hand on Gamora's shoulder, on the verge of full snarl, and moves around her to push between her and Thor.]\nPeter Quill: And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--\nThor: [Not paying attention as he stares at his soup spoon] I need a hammer, not a spoon\u2026. (He attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe\u2026 maybe a birth date or something\u2026.\nPeter Quill:\u00a0What are you doing?\nThor: Taking your pod.\nPeter Quill: [Deepens his voice] No, you're not! [Mimics Thor\u2019s accent] You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.\nRocket: Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?\nPeter Quill:\u00a0No.\nDrax:\u00a0You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.\nPeter Quill:\u00a0No I'm not.\nMantis:\u00a0[Gasp] He just did it again!\nPeter Quill:\u00a0This is my voice!\nThor: [Steps closer to Quill] Are you mocking me?\nPeter Quill:\u00a0Are you mocking me?\nThor:\u00a0Stop it. You did it again.\nPeter Quill: He's trying to copy me.\nThor: Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.\nGamora:\u00a0Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.\nThor: Knowhere.\nMantis:\u00a0He must be going somewhere.\nPeter Quill: No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. [To Thor as he rummages through their food stores.]\nThor:\u00a0Not anymore.\nGamora:\u00a0Thor\u2026 why would he go to Knowhere?\nThor:\u00a0Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.\nPeter Quill:\u00a0If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.\nThor:\u00a0Or a genius.\nGamora:\u00a0[To Thor] How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?\nThor:\u00a0There's six stones out there. [Finishes rummaging and steps in front of Gamora] Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.\nPeter Quill:\u00a0The Avengers?\nThor:\u00a0[By way of explanation.] They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.\nMantis:\u00a0Like Kevin Bacon?\nThor:\u00a0[Pause] He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.\nGamora:\u00a0Then we have to go to Knowhere now.\nThor:\u00a0Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.\nDrax:\u00a0That's a made up word.\nThor:\u00a0All words are made up.\n[It's official: mind blown.]\nRocket:\u00a0Hold up, Nidavellir is real? [Climbing on to the table] Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. [Increasingly gleeful] They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.\nThor:\u00a0The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.\nRocket:\u00a0Rabbit?\nThor:\u00a0Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. [To Rocket] I assume you're the captain, sir?\nRocket:\u00a0You're very perceptive.\nThor:\u00a0You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?\nRocket:\u00a0Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.\nThor:\u00a0Wonderful.\nPeter Quill:\u00a0Except for that I'm the captain.\nThor:\u00a0Quiet!\nPeter Quill:\u00a0That's my backpack.\nRocket:\u00a0Go sit down.\nPeter Quill: [To Thor] Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to\u2026 [gropes for \"Nidavellir\"] Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?\nThor:\u00a0The Thanos killing kind.\nPeter Quill:\u00a0Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?\nThor:\u00a0No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.\nRocket:\u00a0Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?\nThor:\u00a0A little bit. Yeah.\nGamora:\u00a0If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.\nThor:\u00a0He already is.\nRocket:\u00a0I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.\nThor:\u00a0So cool. [Smiles a big grin.]\nPeter Quill: [To Rocket]\u00a0For the record\u2026 I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.\nRocket:\u00a0You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill. [As he enters the pod] Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.\nThor:\u00a0I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.\n[The Guardians nod or wave farewell as Thor, Rocket and Groot depart. Cut to Scotland, where Vision and Wanda Maximoff are sharing a room. Wanda is in bed while Vision, in a human glamour, watches out a window.]\n[High-pitched trilling]\nVision: [Gasps and holds his hand to the Mind Stone in pain.]\nWanda Maximoff:\u00a0Vis? Is it the stone again?\nVision: It's as if it's speaking to me.\nWanda Maximoff:\u00a0What does it say?\nVision: I don't... I don't know. But something...\u00a0\n[The stone trills again and Vision flinches. Wanda takes his face in her hands. Vision turns his head so he can kiss her left palm, then presses Wanda's hand to the Mind Stone.]\nVision: Tell me what you feel.\n[Wanda gestures, her hand emanating her red swirling energy. She seems confused.]\nWanda Maximoff: I just feel you.\n[They kiss.\u00a0Cut to later, where the two are going on a stroll.]\n\u00a0Wanda Maximoff: So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.\nVision: What if I miss that train?\nWanda Maximoff: There is an 11.\nVision: What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?\nWanda Maximoff: You gave Stark your word.\nVision:\u00a0I'd rather give it to you.\nWanda Maximoff: There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.\nVision: Not to each other. [He puts his hands on her shoulders] Wanda\u2026 for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. [Stammers] You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think...\nWanda Maximoff: It works.\nVision: It works.\nVision: Then stay. Stay with me.\n[Wanda looks down, but then her eyes and attention drift to her left.]\nVision: [Suddenly very uncertain] Or not. If I'm overstepping\u2026\n[Wanda steps over to a better view of the TV in the kebab shop at which they had stopped, drawing Vision with her. It shows coverage of the invasion of New York, the alien antagonists, and the disappearance of Tony Stark.]\nWanda Maximoff: [Fearful] What are they?\nVision: What the stone was warning me about. [He kisses her hand] I have to go.\nWanda Maximoff: No, Vision. Vision, if that's true\u2026 then maybe going isn't the best idea.\nVision: Wanda, I\u2026 [Corvus Glaive appears suddenly behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screams, loses his glamour to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and is thrown down into the street.]\nWanda Maximoff: Vision! [She circles her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasts her from behind, knocking the Scarlet Witch across the street and through a bistro's window.]\n[Corvus Glaive pins Vision down and digs the point of his high-tech glaive into Vision's forehead in an attempt to extract the Mind Stone.]\n[The Scarlet Witch commits her own surprise attack, blasts both of the aliens away, then lifts Vision and herself into a nearby courtyard, from where the Scarlet Witch drags him to rest in a concealed alleyway.]\nVision: The blade. It stopped me from phasing.\nWanda Maximoff: Is that even possible?\nVision: It isn't supposed to be. [His voice distorts electronically] My systems are failing. [The Scarlet Witch gestures over his gaping wound, using her magic to knit him back together. Vision continues in a gasping, wry tone] I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.\n[Corvus Glaive suddenly arrives, knocking the Scarlet aside and grabbing Vision into the air,]\nWanda Maximoff: Vis!\n[Corvus flies away with Vision, slamming him against several walls. Meanwhile, Proxima engages the Scarlet Witch with her staff weapon and they too begin to fight.]\nCorvus Glaive: [To Vision] Give up the Stone, and she lives.\n[Vision flies with Corvus to the roof of what appears to be a church, ricocheting off the stone church tower and onto the metal-clad roof.]\n[Simultaneously, Proxima and the Scarlet Witch fight below, staff weapon versus magic energy hands until Proxima uses the blaster effect of her weapon to knock the Scarlet Witch meters away, stunning her as Proxima leaps down, brandishing her weapon within bare inches of the Scarlet Witch's face, only held back by the Scarlet Witch's powers]\n[Furiously, Vision pummels Corvus, then throws him across the roof, firing a beam from the Mind Stone. Corvus uses his glaive to deflect the beam, splitting it into several beams, cutting up Edinburgh's ancient stone like butter, until one branch finally reflects back at Vision, slamming him into the wall behind him.]\n[Down below, the Scarlet Witch has blocked Proxima's staff once again when she hears an agonized cry from Vision. Desperation strengthens her to throw Proxima through the burning lorry sliced in half by the split Stone beam, stunning the alien. The Scarlet Witch then flies up to the roof where Glaive has pinned Vision and is again attempting to remove the Mind Stone.]\nWanda Maximoff: Hands off.\n[The Scarlet Witch casts a bolt of magic which throws Corvus back through the wall and down a shaft, then flies the two of them away again. Proxima, who has recovered, shoots a bolt from her weapon, causing them to fall from the air and down through the roof of Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Wanda crawls over to Vision, who cannot muster the strength to stand.]\nWanda Maximoff:\u00a0[Hushed voice, pleading.] Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.\nVision: Please. Please leave.\nWanda Maximoff: You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.\nVision: Please.\nWanda Maximoff: Get up.\n[Behind them, Proxima and Corvus crash through the roof and advance on them, brandishing their weapons. the Scarlet Witch moves protectively in front of Vision, building power in her hands.]\n[An express train passes behind Wanda, and Proxima cocks her head as if aware of another's presence. Confused, the Scarlet Witch also turns and looks over her left shoulder. As the last train car passes, we see a silhouette on the far side of the platform. Proxima throws her weapon at the shadowy figure, but it is deftly caught just before the figure steps from the shadows.]\n[As the Avengers theme kicks in, we now recognize a bearded and furious Steve Rogers (Captain America) as he steps into the light. Vision and the Scarlet Witch look hopeful and relieved. While all parties are distracted, Sam Wilson (Falcon) swoops in and kicks Proxima across the platform and through the closed cafe's security gate and furniture. Swooping around, he fires on Corvus.]\n[At the same time, Captain America throws Proxima's weapon to Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) who engages Corvus, ducking under his swing, stabbing him in the gut and executing a flying kick to knock him backwards.]\n[Proxima, who has rushed back to the fight, summons her weapon back to her hand and attacks Black Widow. Captain America leaps forward, rolls, scoops up Corvus's dropped glaive and holds her off. Black Widow joins in with her own escrima sticks. While the three are fighting, Falcon returns and again kicks Proxima backwards; she scuttles over to the prone Corvus. Falcon draws both of his Steyr SPP submachine pistols on the couple.]\nProxima Midnight:\u00a0[To Glaive] Get up.\nCorvus Glaive: I can't.\nNatasha Romanoff:\u00a0[Coolly] We don't wanna kill you. But we will.\nProxima Midnight: You'll never get the chance again.\n[Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive\u00a0depart as they are beamed up. The glaive is snatched from Captain America's hand as well.]\nSam Wilson:\u00a0[To Vision] Can you stand?\nVision: [Electricity shimmers over his surface, and his voice distorts] Thank you, Captain.\nSteve Rogers: [Nods] Let's get you on the jet.\nNatasha Romanoff: [Closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Wanda]\u00a0I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.\nWanda Maximoff: I'm sorry. We just wanted time.\nSam Wilson: Where to, Cap?\nSteve Rogers: Home.\n[Cut to the past, at Gamora's\u00a0home planet Zen-Whoberi during Thanos' massacre. Gamora and her mother are hiding; the sounds of guns and screaming are outside.]\u00a0\nGamora's Mother: [To Young Gamora] Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.\n[An explosion goes off close by and Gamora screeches by reflex, revealing their hiding spot.]\nChild of Thanos: [Untranslated inquiry.]\n[The door is smashed open and both Zehobereians scream.]\n[Outside, it is utter chaos. Leviathans, Chitauri chariots and ring-ships fly overhead; explosions and energy bolts from numerous sources criss-cross the panicked population, felling them randomly; smoke arises from countless fires.]\nEbony Maw: \u00a0Zehobereians\u2026\nYoung Gamora: [Being dragged by one arm through the crowds] Mother! Where's my mother?!\nEbony Maw: Choose a side, or die.\nYoung Gamora: Mother! [She punches at the arm of the one dragging her who surprisingly drops her arm and leaves.]\nEbony Maw: One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.\n[Gamora turns and finds herself facing Thanos in his full Titan armor.]\nThanos: What's wrong, little one?\nYoung Gamora: My mother. Where is my mother?\nThanos: [Kneels down to Gamora] What's your name?\nYoung Gamora: Gamora.\nThanos: You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. [Thanos offers his hand; she wraps her little fingers around one massive finger, and he leads her to a pavilion, where he crouches to her eye level again and produces a small -- for him -- red-jeweled handle. Pressing the switch, razor-sharp blades pop out both ends.] Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other\u2026 [He balances it on one finger, overbalances it purposefully and catches it.] Here. You try.\n[Thanos hands Gamora the dagger -- the handle is two child-palms' widths in length. She tries balancing it on her index finger.]\nEbony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.\n[One half of the crowd is shot down. The survivors scream in horror, and Gamora tries to turn but Thanos prevents her from seeing the massacre.]\nThanos: Concentrate. There! You've got it.\n[Cut to the present, aboard the GUARDIANS\u2019 ship. Gamora is brooding, activates the spring-action blades on the same dagger.]\nPeter Quill: Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the \"blow off your junk\" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--\nGamora: I need to ask a favor.\nPeter Quill: Yeah, sure.\nGamora: One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.\nPeter Quill: Which is what the grenades are for. [Gamora silences him with a look.] I'm sorry. What's the favor?\nGamora: If things go wrong\u2026 If Thanos gets me\u2026 I want you to promise me\u2026 you'll kill me.\nPeter Quill: [A beat. Confusion.] What?\nGamora: I know something he doesn't. If he finds out\u2026 the entire Universe could be at risk.\nPeter Quill: \u00a0What do you know?\nGamora: If I tell you, you'd know, too.\nPeter Quill: If it's so important, shouldn't I?\nGamora: Only if you wanna die.\nPeter Quill: Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?\nGamora: Just\u2026 trust me. And possibly, kill me.\nPeter Quill: I mean, I'd like to. I really would\u2026 [Gamora silences him by covering his mouth with her hand.]\nGamora: Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.\nPeter Quill: [A beat. One that rests with him significantly.] Okay.\n[The two kiss, until an odd crunching sound startles them. Drax is standing in the corner.]\nPeter Quill: Dude. How long have you been standing there?\nDrax: An hour.\nPeter Quill: An hour? Are you serious?\nDrax: I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.\n[Drax stands motionless, then very slowly raises his hand towards his mouth]\nPeter Quill: You're eating a zarg-nut.\nDrax: But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.\nPeter Quill: Mmm, no. [Quill and Gamora shake their heads.]\nDrax: I'm sure I'm invisible.\nMantis: Hi, Drax.\nDrax: [Knowing when he is beat] Damn it.\n[The Benatar flies towards a massive skull and flies through one eye-hole into a vast interior cavern. Screen title: KNOWHERE.]\nPeter Quill: This place looks deserted.\nDrax: I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.\nPeter Quill: Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.\n[The four Guardians disembark and sneak into the Collector\u2019s collection room, which is in ruins. Thanos is threatening the Collector while the Guardians hide behind rubble.]\nCollector: I don't have it.\nThanos: Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.\n[Quill stops, and holds up a fist meaning 'halt' in the silent language of soldiers. Everybody walks quietly past him.]\nThanos: I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. [Thanos places a heavy boot on the middle of the Collector's chest and presses.]\nCollector: [Strained] I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?\nThanos: I imagine it's like breathing for you.\nCollector: Like suicide.\nThanos: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.\nCollector: I didn't know what it was.\nThanos: Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?\nDrax: Today...\nPeter Quill: [Grasping the danger] Drax. Drax.\nDrax: ...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.\nPeter Quill: Drax, waaaaait! [Drax draws his long dagger from his leg scabbard.] Not yet, not yet, not yet. [Drax gives him a look and heads towards Thanos. Quill hurries as quietly as possible to catch up.] Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.\nDrax: No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.\n[Quill starts to struggle with Drax when Mantis puts her hand on the back of Drax's head.]\nMantis: Sleeeep. [Drax is knocked out, his falling body causing a loud crash. Everybody ducks.]\n[Thanos looks towards the sound, then picks up the Collector and throws him into a collecting case before walking towards the disturbance.]\nPeter Quill: Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... [Gamora moves towards Thanos] The other right!\n[Gamora leaps on Thanos from a stack of boxes, swinging her sword at him. He snaps the sword-blade in half, and Gamora stabs him in the throat with the stub, his lower jaw sagging and himself letting out a hoarse groan, then he is stabbed in the chest with the red-jeweled dagger.]\nThanos: Why? [He falls down] Why you? Daughter\u2026 [He holds his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound, before collapsing completely. Gamora breaks down, sobbing.]\nPeter Quill: [Surprised] That was quick.\nCollector: Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!\n[Suddenly, Thanos' disembodied voice fills the room.]\nThanos: Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.\n[The scene disappears -- everything in the room is destroyed and/or on fire, the Collector waving bye-bye as he and his case vanish.]\nThanos: That is, it was. Now\u2026 reality can be whatever I want.\n[Thanos is quite alive and undamaged. He has the red Reality Stone seated in the Infinity Gauntlet.]\nGamora: [Her face still wet, but no longer crying] You knew I'd come.\nThanos: I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.\n[Gamora hesitates for a beat, then reaches for her broken sword. Thanos grabs her by the back of the neck and swings her around in front of him.]\nDrax: Thanos!\n[With a pulse of the Reality Stone, both Drax and Mantis are 'disassembled' -- Drax is turned into a stack of tumbling cubes, and Mantis becomes a ribbon version of herself.]\nPeter Quill: [Moving in, his blaster pointed right at Thanos] Let her go, Grimace!\nGamora: Peter\u2026\nPeter Quill: [To Gamora] I told you to go right.\nGamora: Now? Really?\nPeter Quill: You let her go!\nThanos: Ah, the boyfriend.\nPeter Quill: I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.\nGamora: Peter\u2026\nPeter Quill: Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!\nGamora: Not him.\n[Quill hesitates. He does not shoot anyone.]\nGamora: You promised! You promised.\nThanos: Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. [to Quill] She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. [There is a very tense and unpleasant pause. Thanos rolls his head and shoves Gamora towards Quill\u2019s gun, egging him on.] DO IT!!\nPeter Quill: [Tearing up] I told you to go right.\nGamora: I love you, more than anything.\nPeter Quill: I love you, too.\n[Quill screws up his eyes and pulls the trigger -- but a stream of bubbles comes out. Thanos was playing him.]\nThanos: [Genuinely sincere] I like you.\n[Thanos teleports Gamora and himself away as a stunned Quill picks up Gamora's sword, and his friends painfully re-assemble themselves, the Reality Stone's effects now subsiding in its absence.]\n(Back on Earth, the Quinjet arrives at the upstate New York Avengers HQ while Col. James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes deals with the red tape in the holographic person of Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (Lt. Gen., USA Ret.).)\nSecretary Ross: Still no word from Vision?\nJames Rhodes: Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.\nSecretary Ross: On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.\nJames Rhodes: You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?\nSecretary Ross: My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.\nJames Rhodes: If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.\nSecretary Ross: I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.\nJames Rhodes: [Sounding a little bitter] That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. [We get a good look at his leg braces]\nSecretary Ross: You have second thoughts?\nJames Rhodes: Not anymore.\n[The fugitive Avengers enter the room, Vision supported by Sam.]\nSteve Rogers: Mr. Secretary.\nSecretary Ross: You got some nerve. I'll give you that.\nNatasha Romanoff: You could use some of that right now.\nSecretary Ross: The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?\nSteve Rogers: I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. [Steve takes a step forward, looking right at Ross] And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.\nSecretary Ross: [To Rhodes] Arrest them.\nJames Rhodes: All over it. [Swipes off hologram; the computer beeps twice] That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.\nSteve Rogers: [Hugging Rhodes] You too, Rhodey. [Natasha gets her own embrace.]\nJames Rhodes: Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.\nSam Wilson: Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.\nBruce Banner: Uh, I think you look great. [Rhodes and Natasha long round to see Bruce walking in from the opposite end of the room.]  Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.\nNatasha Romanoff: Hi, Bruce.\nBruce Banner: Nat.\nSam Wilson: [Whispering] This is awkward.\n[Cut to a shot of Natasha, Bruce, Steve, Rhodey, Wanda, and Vision in another room.]\nJames Rhodes: So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?\nWanda Maximoff: And they can clearly find us.\nBruce Banner: We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?\nNatasha Romanoff: After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.\nBruce Banner: Who's Scott?\nSteve Rogers: Ant-Man.\nBruce Banner: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look\u2026 Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.\nNatasha Romanoff: Well then, we have to protect it.\nVision: No, we have to destroy it.\u00a0I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps\u2026 its molecular integrity could fail. [Vision addresses Wanda as he nears her.]\nWanda Maximoff: And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.\nVision: Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.\nWanda Maximoff: That's too high a price.\nVision: [Takes her face gently in both hands] Only you have the power to pay it. [Wanda walks away, distressed] Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.\nSteve Rogers: [Eyes diverted down] But it should. [Looks up at Vision] We don't trade lives, Vision.\nVision: [Walking toward Steve] Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?\n[Steve takes a breath, but before he has a chance to answer, Bruce speaks.]\nBruce Banner: Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.\nWanda Maximoff: You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?\nBruce Banner: I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.\nNatasha Romanoff: Can we do that?\nBruce Banner: Not me. Not here.\nJames Rhodes: You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.\nSteve Rogers: I know somewhere.\n[Cut to rural Wakanda, as King T'Challa and Okoye walk together, accompanied by two Kingsguard. Screen title: WAKANDA.]\nOkoye: You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.\nKing T'Challa: And the Border Tribe?\nOkoye: Those that are left.\nKing T'Challa: Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.\nOkoye: And what of this one?\nKing T'Challa: This one may be tired of war. [James \"Bucky\" Buchanan Barnes is seen at a small distance throwing a bag from a pile on the ground onto a partly-filled cart, while two village children watch] But the White Wolf has rested long enough.\n[The party reaches Bucky. A Kingsguards-man sets an elaborate and high-tech-looking equipment case down on the cart, opens the lid, and steps back. As the Winter Soldier approaches, he sees a new Vibranium arm in the case.]\nBucky Barnes: [With resignation] Where's the fight?\nKing T'Challa: On its way.\n[Cut to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange is floating horizontally, face down, and is surrounded by dozens of glassy needles, each about two feet long.]\nEbony Maw: In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement. [The needles start to contact Dr. Strange's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch] Give me... the stone.\n[Cut to Tony who is watching, hidden, from above. The Cloak of Levitation taps Stark on the arm. He raises his hand to it, ready to shoot, but he sees what it is and stands down.]\nTony Stark: Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?\nPeter Parker: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....\n[Tony and the Cloak turn to face Peter, dropping down from above]\nTony Stark: What the--\nPeter Parker: I know what you're gonna say.\nTony Stark: You should not be here.\n[The Cloak moves to \"stand\" at Tony's side]\nPeter Parker: I was gonna go home--\nTony Stark: I don't wanna hear it.\nPeter Parker: But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...\nTony Stark: And now I gotta hear it.\n[The Cloak shakes its collar in sympathy and shrugs]\nPeter Parker: ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.\n[The Cloak looks shocked.]\nTony Stark: [Seriously] What did you just say?\nPeter Parker: I take that back. And now I'm here in space.\nTony Stark: Yeah. [Tony crosses to stand right in front of Peter] Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.\nPeter Parker: No. I did think this through.\nTony Stark: You could not have possibly thought this through.\nPeter Parker: It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man when there's no neighborhood. [He waits for Tony's reaction] Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.\nTony Stark: [Breaths shakily] Come on. We got a situation. [He leads Peter over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Peter crouches to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder.] See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.\nPeter Parker: Um. Okay, okay... uh... [Peter and the Cloak pop back upright] Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?\n[The Cloak lifts its collar in surprise.]\n[Cut back to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange, who groans loudly.]\nEbony Maw: Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...\n[At the \"thump\" behind him, Maw turns to see Iron Man standing there, hand repulsors ready to fire.]\nEbony Maw: ...Could end your friend's life in an instant.\nTony Stark: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.\nEbony Maw: [Walks slowly towards Iron Man, beckoning very large, very solid metal objects to float behind him] You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.\nTony Stark: Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.\n[Iron Man fires a rocket from his shoulder which pierces the side of the ship to Maw's right and begins to suck everything out with depressurization, especially Maw and his large objects. Dr. Strange is pulled loose of his pinnings, loses the needles, but also heads for the hole, helpless to resist. The Cape wraps around his arm and an anchor point, but Dr. Strange's arm slips loose and he keeps going. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Dr. Strange with one hand and holds onto a piece of the ship with the other. It breaks, sending them both towards space when his Iron-Spider suit's metal arms brace him to keep him from being sucked out. Fortunately, Dr. Strange is still surrounded by the ship's atmosphere making haste to leave.]\nPeter Parker: Yes! Wait what are those?!\n[Spider-Man crouches with his new spider-legs, and makes a mighty leap to pulls them both back inside. Iron Man quickly sprays nanites onto the hole to plug it up. Dr. Strange safely, if emphatically, hits the floor. Ebony Maw is seen floating in space, quite dead, ice from the escaped atmosphere frosting over his grimace. Spider-Man lands on his new legs, retracts them, and finds the Cape \"standing\" next to him.]\nPeter Parker: Hey, we haven't officially met. [He offers the Cape his hand to shake. It ignores his offer and continues to Dr. Strange.] Cool.\n[Iron Man walks past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange gets to his feet and becomes en-Cloaked.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: We've gotta turn this ship around.\nTony Stark: Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.\nDr. Stephen Strange: No, I want to protect the stone.\n[Tony walks towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect.]\nTony Stark: [Irritably] And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.\nDr. Stephen Strange: For what? Nearly blasting me into space?\nTony Stark: Who just saved your magical ass? Me.\nDr. Stephen Strange: I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.\nTony Stark: Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.\nTony Stark: And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.\n[Seriously, these two's egos are a recipe for disaster.] \nPeter Parker: [Raises his hand] I'm backup.\nTony Stark: No. You're a stowaway. [Waggles a finger between himself and Dr. Strange] The adults are talking.\nDr. Stephen Strange: I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?\nPeter Parker: No. I'm Peter, by the way.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Dr. Strange.\nPeter Parker: Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.\nTony Stark: This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Walks closer to Tony] Can we control it? Fly us home? [Tony is lost in bad memories and does not respond right away.] Stark?\nTony Stark: Yeah?\nDr. Stephen Strange: Can you get us home?\nTony Stark: Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.\nTony Stark: [Stalks over to Strange] No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Pauses] Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.\nTony Stark: Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight. [Stepping over to Peter, he formally taps each of Peter's shoulders with the edge of his hand, dubbing him as is done at a knighting.] Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. [He doesn't look at him as he says those words, knowing well what he is signing him up for.]\n[Peter looks at Tony in disbelief, and then cycles through delight, satisfaction, pride and determination, and braces himself for what's to come.]\n[Cut to Thanos' mother-ship, Sanctuary II, which dwarfs the massive ring-ships the Black Order have been using. Gamora sits near the throne deep inside the ship. Thanos walks up, bringing a cup of food and holds it out to her.]\nThanos: I thought you might be hungry.\n[Gamora takes it, then hurls it across the room where it bangs against Thanos' throne with a loud clack.]\nGamora: I always hated that chair.\nThanos: So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.\nGamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.\nThanos: You told me that too. [Thanos mounts two of the four steps to his throne, turns, and sits on the second from the top.] Every day. For almost twenty years.\nGamora: I was a child when you took me.\nThanos: I saved you.\nGamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.\nThanos: Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.\nGamora: Because you murdered half the planet.\nThanos: A small price to pay for salvation.\nGamora: You're insane.\nThanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.\nGamora: You don't know that!\nThanos: [Scowls as his egotistical narcissism prevents him from fully listening to her] I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. [He stands again and walks back to Gamora] For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.\nGamora: I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.\nThanos: And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.\nGamora: I'm sorry I disappointed you.\nThanos: I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. [Leans down to put their heads at a level, whispering fiercely] But because you did. [Looks at her] And you lied.\n[Thanos and Gamora stand outside a large solid door that slides open vertically as they approach, then pause as a set of inner doors made of interlacing metal slide away. Inside, we see Nebula face-on, suspended horizontally in the air in the middle of the room, her breath shuddering in pain.]\nGamora: Nebula.\n[Gamora hurries to to Nebula's left side, and we now see that she has been partially disassembled, her components stretched apart -- a cybernetic version of the medieval torture rack. Hannibal Lecter level of brutality.]\nGamora: Don't do this.\nThanos: Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.\nGamora: Please don't do this.\nThanos: And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.\n[Thanos curls his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling -- causing Nebula's already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She begins to scream.]\nGamora: Stop. Stop it. [She puts her hands on the gauntlet, pulling it down] I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.\n[Thanos signals a nearby servant who taps on a control pad. We hear Nebula's voice say, \"Accessing memory files\" and a sort of hologram of Gamora's face shudders to life.]\nMemory Nebula: You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.\nMemory Gamora: He can never get them all.\nMemory Nebula: He will!\nMemory Gamora: He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.\n[The memory ends.]\nThanos: [To Gamora, walking around behind her] You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. [His voice drips with disgust] Where is the Soul Stone? [He raises his gauntlet next to Gamora's face. Nebula shakes her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister's silence but when Gamora does not answer, Thanos clenches the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stones are reactivated. Gamora grimaces in shared pain at her sister's screams, growing louder as Thanos increases the pressure.]\nGamora: Vormir! [Thanos unclenches his hand, and Nebula gasps in air as her parts snap back almost into place. Gamora goes to her and caresses her face.] The Stone is on Vormir.\nThanos: [Satisfied.] Show me.\n[Cut to the pod taking Thor, Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir.]\nGroot: [Irritably] I am Groot.\nRocket: Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.\nGroot: [Still irritably] I am Groot.\nThor: [While looking out the rear portholes] Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.\nRocket: You speak Groot?\nThor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.\nGroot: [Shortly] I am Groot.\nThor: You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. [Nostalgically] It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.\n[Rocket turns to see Thor sitting sadly beside the window, and sighs.]\nRocket: [To himself] Okay, time to be the captain. [Walks to a console near by Thor, presses two buttons] So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.\nThor: Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.\nRocket: And you said your sister and your dad?\nThor: Both dead.\nRocket: Still got a mom, though?\nThor: Killed by a dark elf.\nRocket: A best friend?\nThor: Stabbed through the heart.\nRocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?\nThor: [Smiling widely but also trying to convince himself] Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.\nRocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.\nThor: Well, he's never fought me.\nRocket: Yeah, he has!\nThor: He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.\nRocket: Better be some hammer.\nThor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.\nRocket: And what if you're wrong?\nThor: If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?\n[Thor sniffs and hastily wipes below his eye. He stands and seats himself at the front of the pod, beside Groot.]\nRocket: [Under his breath] I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. [Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person] Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. [He gives Thor the eyeball.]\nThor: What's this?\nRocket: What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.\nThor: He gave you his eye?\nRocket: He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.\nThor: Thank you, sweet rabbit.\n[Thor proceeds to put the eyeball in his socket. We are thankfully spared the explicit insertion.]\nRocket: Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...[beeping] Hey, we're here!\nThor: [Smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated] I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.\nRocket: It ain't the eye.\n[Nidavellir is dark and motionless as the three rings around it.]\nThor: Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.\n[The pod flies through massive machinery, cold and inert. Screen title: NIDAVELLIR]\n[The pod sets down; Thor, Rocket and Groot disembark and start walking through a seemingly abandoned and cluttered space. Groot is still playing his game.]\nRocket: I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.\nThor: This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....\nRocket: [Pauses, looking at a pedestal] You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?\nThor: Yes. Why?\nRocket: Look anything like that? [In fact, it looks exactly like that]\nGroot: [Uneasily] I am Groot.\nThor: [Urgently] Go back to the pod.\n[Suddenly a massive figure storms towards them, flinging Thor away with one swing of his arm, and kicking Rocket and Groot against a wall of equipment.]\nThor: Eitri, wait! Stop!\nEitri: Thor?\n[Eitri is played by the legendary Peter Dinklage -- his giant size literally juxtaposing his name of dwarf.]\nThor: What happened here?\nEitri: You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!\nThor: Asgard is destroyed. [Thor scrambles to his feet and points. Eitri stop his attack on Thor. He now believes Thanos had destroyed Asgard and leaving him in a similar survivor role like Eitri himself.] Eitri, the glove. What did you do?\nEitri: [He walks brokenly across the space to sit heavily, leaning against an ore skip. Rocket and Groot get to their feet, the sapling checking his game.] 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.' [He holds up his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal.]\nThor: Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed...\u00a0every ax, hammer, sword... it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is\u00a0lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.\n[Cut to Nebula suspended in the interrogation room seen earlier, while a technician puts her back together. Nebula ejects her eyepiece and snaps the neck of the tech when he comes close enough to replace it. She walks to a console, straightening her left arm, dragging her still-dislocated right foot behind her, and inputs a code.]\nNebula: Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.\n[Cut to Peter Parker, Tony Stark, and Dr. Strange aboard the ship approaching the surface of Titan.]\nPeter Parker: [To Tony] Hey, what's going on?\nDr. Stephen Strange: I think we're here.\nTony Stark: I don't think this rig has a self-park function. [Urgently] Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?\nPeter Parker: Yep, got it.\nTony Stark: This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.\nPeter Parker: Okay. Okay. Ready.\n[The ringship is heading straight for the center of what looks like one of a colossal game of jacks.]\nPeter Parker: We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!\n[Iron Man armors up as the ringship clips the \"jack\" obliquely, but still losing a good third of its hull in the collision. Spider-Man throws up his helmet at the same time. Doctor Strange steps between them and creates the Shield of the Seraphim around them all, anticipating a rough landing.]\n[The ship, now reduced to about 45%, plows through the dirt and stops, leaning slightly to one side. Screen title: TITAN.]\n[Doctor Strange helps Tony, now de-helmeted, to his feet; they're both panting a little from the exertion of arrival.]\nTony Stark: [To Doctor Strange] You alright? [Panting] That was close. I owe you one.\n[Spider-Man descends from above in classically spider-like fashion.]\nPeter Parker: Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.\nTony Stark: [While pointing at Peter] I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?\nPeter Parker: I'm trying to say that... something is coming.\n[A grenade rolls into view, and Peter, Strange and Tony get thrown well back when it fires its energy pulse. Star-Lord, Drax, and Mantis appear in the doorway]\nDrax: [Yelling] THANOS!!!! [He flings a blade at Doctor Strange, who neatly deflects it with a mystical shield, and in return sends the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor. Star-Lord and Iron Man have a brief dogfight until a magnetic disc pins Iron Man face-first to a structure.]\nPeter Parker: [Crawling backwards frantically from an anxious-looking Mantis] AH! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!\n[Spider-Man shoots web at Mantis in a panic, pinning arms to her body just before Star-Lord flies at him feet-first, kicking him away.]\nPeter Quill: Stay down, clown!\n[Star-Lord can't quite counter spider reflexes at first; he fires at Spider-Man, who extends his spider legs and leaps away, but an electric-like cord wraps around Spider-Man and his six new legs when he tries to attack, sending him rolling across the deck.]\nDrax: [Struggling with the Cloak of Levitation] Die, blanket of death!\n[Iron Man pulls free of the magnet; the Cloak pulls free of Drax as soon as Iron Man has a bead on his opponent and a foot on his torso.]\n[Star-Lord has Spider-Man in a head-lock, gun pointed at the smaller man's head.]\n[Doctor Strange has a mystical shield of golden energy up, and stands ready at the third point of the triangle. Mantis has struggled to her feet behind Star-Lord, still covered with webbing.]\nPeter Quill: Alright, everybody, stay where you are... chill the F out. [Star-Lord powers off his helmet] I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?\nTony Stark: [De-helmeting] Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?\nDrax: I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?!\nPeter Quill: Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.\nTony Stark: Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! [Tony extends his nano-tech cannon, looking uncannily like an electric shark about to eat Drax's face.]\nDrax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.\nMantis: No, he can't take it!\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Completely deadpan] She's right. You can't.\nPeter Quill: Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. [To Spider-Man] Starting with you.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Wait, what. Thanos? [Trying to inject clarity and sanity into the situation] Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve?\nPeter Quill: What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? \"Jesus\"?\nTony Stark: [Getting it] You're from Earth?\nPeter Quill: I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.\nTony Stark: Yeah, that's on EARTH, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?\nPeter Parker: [Sounding slightly crushed] So, you're not with Thanos?\nPeter Quill: [Indignantly] WITH Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl. Wait... who are you?\nPeter Parker: [De-helmets] We're the Avengers, man.\nPeter Quill: Oh.\nMantis: You're the ones Thor told us about!\nTony Stark: You know Thor!?\nPeter Quill: Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, [Peter gives him an incredulous look] needed saving.\nDoctor Strange: [Pause] Where is he now?\n[Cut to Nivadellir where Eitri is showing Thor, Rocket, and Groot the mold for Stormbreaker.]\nRocket: This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?\nEitri: It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.\nThor: Did it have a name?\nEitri: Stormbreaker.\nRocket: That's a bit much.\nThor: So how do we make it?\nEitri: You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.\nThor: Rabbit, fire up the pod.\n[Cut to Titan where the remaining Avengers and the Guardians are starting to work together. Quill is measuring the planet's tilt.]\nPeter Quill: The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.\n[in the background, Mantis is jumping joyfully in a low gravity spot.]\nTony Stark: Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.\n[Drax yawns.]\nTony Stark: Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?\nDrax: I stopped listening after you said, \"We need a plan.\"\nTony Stark: [To Quill] Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.\nPeter Quill: See, \"not winging it\" isn't really what they do.\nPeter Parker: Uh, what exactly is it that they do?\nMantis: [As fiercely as an 8-week-old kitten] Kick names, take ass.\nDrax: Yeah, that's right. [Agrees quietly as he settles into a stance facing the remaining Avengers.]\nTony Stark: [Tony pauses with an expression of deep hopelessness] Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?\nPeter Quill: \"Mr. Lord.\" Star-Lord is fine. [Motions to Drax and Mantis,]\nTony Stark: We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....\nPeter Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. [Peter Parker follows the conversation back and forth like a squash rally.]\nDrax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.\nTony Stark: What dance-off?\nPeter Quill: It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.\nPeter Parker: Like in Footloose, the movie?\nPeter Quill: [Excitedly] Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?\nPeter Parker: It never was.\n[Quill frowns sadly at him.]\nTony Stark: Don't encourage this, alright?\nPeter Parker: Okay.\nTony Stark: We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.\nPeter Quill: Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. [Quill points at Stark and Parker] So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.\nTony Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.\nMantis: Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?\n[Dr. Strange is sitting cross-legged, floating slightly above the ground, his hands poised in a mystic gesture with the Time Stone glowing brightly in the Eye of Agamotto setting. Green vapor-like energy flows from the stone, and more intricate magical energy patterns circle Dr. Strange's forearms. The Cloak of Levitation flows behind him as if the Stone is creating a strong breeze. His eyes are closed, and his head is jerking rapidly from side to side, the motion blurring, but resembling looking for something.]\nTony Stark: Strange! We alright?\n[Dr. Strange snaps out of his trance and falls forward, letting out a cry.]\nTony Stark: You're back. You're alright.\nPeter Parker: Hey, what was that?\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Panting] I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.\nPeter Quill: How many did you see?\nDr. Stephen Strange:14,000,605.\nTony Stark: How many did we win?\n[Dr. Strange stares intently at Tony for a moment.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Pause] One.\n[Cut to Thanos and Gamora appearing on sand dunes alternating with shallow pools around the base of a mountain. The sun is in full eclipse, lending eerie lighting to the scene. Screen title: VORMIR]\nThanos: The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake.\n[The walk up the mountain seems to be long, but not difficult. Paths worn by centuries or more of feet lead up to the summit, where Thanos and Gamora encounter a floating hooded figure].\nStonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.\nThanos: You know us?\nStonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.\nThanos: Where's the Soul Stone?\nStonekeeper: You should know... it extracts a terrible price.\nThanos: I am prepared.\nStonekeeper: We all think that at first. [The figure touches down and glides out of the shadows, revealing the face of who we know to be Johann \"The Red Skull\" Schmidt from Captain America: The First Avenger.] We are all wrong.\n[The Stonekeeper guides them to a temple-like structure at the summit.]\nThanos: How is it you know this place so well?\nRed Skull: A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.\n[They stop on a semicircular engraving overlooking a sheer drop. It descends in three shallow steps to a final half-circle cutout, the whole bisected by a deep cut that runs between the two spires behind them. Far, far below is a full circle with similar engraved decoration.]\nRed Skull: What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.\nThanos: What's this?\nRed Skull: The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.\nThanos: Tell me what it needs.\nRed Skull: To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.\nThanos: Of what?\nRed Skull: In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul... for a soul.\n[Gamora begins to laugh at the irony of the situation.]\nGamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.\nThanos: [Turns to face Gamora with tears in his eyes.]\nGamora: Really? Tears?\nRed Skull: They're not for him.\n[Gamora looks at the Red Skull, and as her bitter smile fades, realizes what is about to happen, as do we.... ]\nGamora: No. This isn't love.\nThanos: [Thoroughly convicted.] I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. [Gamora stares down unseeing for a moment, then up at the resolution on his face. She grabs the red-jeweled dagger from his belt with lightning reflexes, triggers the blades and stabs herself in the stomach... except it's only bubbles.] I'm sorry, little one. [He grabs Gamora by the arm and walks inexorably to the precipice.]\nGamora: NO!\n[She tries in vain to break from his grasp, much like she tried to pull free from the Child of Thanos so many years ago, but, pain showing clearly on his face, he throws her over the edge, and watches sorrowfully as she falls to her death. Light pulses overhead as the sacrifice is correctly accomplished.]\n[Thanos finds himself lying in one of the shallow pools back at the base of the mountain. He opens his hand and sees that he now has the orange Soul Stone.]\n[Cut to the Quinjet where Sam is piloting Rhodey, Steve, Natasha, Wanda, and Vision.]\nSteve Rogers: [Walking up to the pilot's seat] Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.\nSam Wilson: I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.\n[The Quinjet passes through a camouflage force field into Wakanda's Golden City's valley and lands at the airfield outside the palace. King T'Challa and the Dora Milaje approach to greet the arrivals]\nOkoye: [Walking with King T'Challa and a band of the Kingsguard to the landing pad] When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined.\nKing T'Challa: And what did you imagine?\nOkoye: The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.\n[The occupants of the Quinjet disembark, Steve and Natasha leading, followed by Bruce and Rhodey, with Vision and Wanda slowly taking up the rear.]\nBruce Banner: [To Rhodey] Should we bow?\nJames Rhodes: [Seriously] Yeah, he's a king.\nSteve Rogers: Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. [Shaking hands with King T'Challa.]\n[Bruce bows awkwardly to King T'Challa.]\nJames Rhodes: [Mock shocked] What are you doing?\nT'Challa: Uh, we don't do that here. [He dissuades Bruce with a motion of his hand; Bruce shoots Rhodey a look, and is answered with a big grin] So how big of an assault can we expect?\n[The group begins to walk back into the administrative building.]\nBruce Banner: Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.\nNatasha Romanoff: How we looking?\nKing T'Challa: You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...\nBucky Barnes: [Smiling as he walks toward Steve, passing some Kingsguard taking Vision and Wanda to another facility] A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.\n[The two friends share a hug.]\nSteve Rogers: How you been, Buck?\nBucky Barnes: Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.\n[In Shuri's lab, Shuri scans the Stone with her kimoyo beads while Vision lies on the examination table. She flips her hand over and studies the hologram projected over her palm.]\nShuri: Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.\nBruce Banner: Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.\nShuri: Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?\n[Vision looks at Bruce as if to ask the same thing.]\nBruce Banner: [Uncertainly] Because, we didn't think of it.\nShuri: [Reassuringly, with a smile] I'm sure you did your best.\nWanda Maximoff: Can you do it?\nShuri: Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. [To King T'Challa] It will take time, brother.\nSteve Rogers: How long?\nShuri: As long as you can give me.\nOkoye: [Her kimoyo beads chime an alarm; she flicks one bead into her palm, where it projects the globe with a pulsing location marker] Something's entered the atmosphere.\n[Outside, Sam and Bucky look up at the sky]\nSam Wilson: [Over the Avengers' comm] Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.\n[The defense shield over the Golden City destroys one of the alien vessels when it slams into the field at full attack acceleration.]\nBucky Barnes: God, I love this place.\nJames Rhodes: [also outside, and now in full War Machine armor watching three more ships burn through the sky] Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.\n[The shock waves and debris from the ship landings destroy acres of forest and boil up against the dome. The lab has an excellent view of the landing sites. Captain America and Black Panther look at each other in concern over the scope of what they'll be facing.]\nVision: [Struggling to sit up and slide off the exam table] It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.\nNatasha Romanoff: [Moving toward Vision] Vision, get your ass back on the table.\nT'Challa: We will hold them off. [He, Okoye and the guards head for the door.]\nSteve Rogers: [To Wanda] Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.\nWanda Maximoff: I will.\nKing T'Challa: Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. [He stops, turns, and points at Steve] And get this man a shield.\n[Cut to Nivadellir where Rocket is in the pod, and Thor, without any environmental suit, jumps from the hull onto the ring surface with a cable in his hand attached to the pod.]\nRocket: I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.\nThor: Leave that to me.\nRocket: Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a--\nThor: [Thor begins to swing the pod around him in a circle. Rocket screams. Thor builds up speed with three good loops then slacks his grip enough to send the pod shooting straight away from Nidavellir, trailing him behind it like a kite tail.] Fire the engines!\nRocket: [Rocket shakes it off and puts the proverbial pedal to the metal.] Nnnyah!\nThor: [As the pod skims over the surface of the next ring out, Thor reaches down and digs one hand into the surface, then both feet, finally getting a foothold against the forward motion of the pod. The ice-like accumulation around the ring axis crackles.] MORE... POWER... RABBIT!\n[Thor commits bicep porn while Rocket accelerates for all he's worth. Finally the rings spin free, realigning into effective configuration as the star bursts back into life.]\nEitri: Well done, boy.\n[Thor, clutching the pod's forward windows, points to the star.]\nThor: That's Nivadellir!\n[Rocket gazes amazed at the blazing core. An iris on the cladding around the star opens, firing pure stellar heat through the ring portals and into the forge... until the damaged mechanism fails, crumbles loose and slams shut. The iris closes and the beam of light trails off.]\nEitri: Damn it.\nRocket: \"Damn it\"? What's \"damn it\"?\nEitri: The mechanism is crippled.\nThor: What?\nEitri: With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.\nThor: How long will it take to heat?\nEitri: A few minutes, maybe more. Why?\nThor: [Standing up on the pod hull] I'm gonna hold it open.\nEitri: That's suicide.\nThor: So is facing Thanos without that ax. [He leaps from the pod to the star's iris.]\n[Cut to the Wakandan battlefield. Carriers hover over the ground with Wakandan soldiers and Natasha, Steve and Bucky on board; Rhodey and Sam keep pace overhead, and Bruce is in the Hulkbuster armor.]\nNatasha Romanoff: How we looking, Bruce?\nBruce Banner: [Leaping jogging along, keeping up with the carriers, and utterly delighted] Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-- [he stumbles on a rock, and a carrier goes by, from which Okoye gives him a dubious look. He stands] I'm okay. I'm okay.\nJames Rhodes: I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.\n[The heat signatures are Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian.]\n[The carrier pilots swerve into U-turns, causing their craft to tilt and allowing the practiced soldiers to slide over one side into a run, never coming to a complete halt. A Dora Milaje shouts a command nearby as the last Wakandans join ranks.]\nJabari Warriors: MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! MAYEFA YA HU! [M'Baku, Lord of the Jabari, rallies his soldiers with a war chant. He stops as King T'Challa nears him.]\nKing T'Challa: [Clasps wrists with M'Baku] Thank you for standing with us.\nM'Baku: [Translated from Xhosa] Of course, brother.\n[The Black Panther, Captain America, and Black Widow walk to the edge of the barrier, where Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian stand. Proxima tests the strength of the barrier by drawing her sword across it consideringly.]\nNatasha Romanoff: Where's your other friend?\nProxima Midnight: You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.\nSteve Rogers: That's not gonna happen.\nKing T'Challa: You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.\nProxima Midnight: We... have blood to spare. [She brandishes her sword with a snarl, and the ships behind her start raising their outer hulls to allow their \"passengers\" to disembark.]\n[The three heroes return to the massed forces.]\nBucky Barnes: [A touch sardonically] Did they surrender?\nSteve Rogers: Not exactly.\n[The Black Panther leads the Wakandans in the war cry \"Yibambe!\" telling them to hold fast as the Outriders bound toward the barrier; Proxima drops her sword arm down in the signal to attack.]\nBucky Barnes: [Flatly, astonished at the numbers of Outriders] What the hell.\nNatasha Romanoff: Looks like we pissed her off.\nOkoye: [Horrified, as the Outriders bombard the force-field, squeezing limbs and bodies partly through only to be bisected.] They're killing themselves.\n[As a few Outriders managed to squeeze through intact, the Border Tribe take a knee and raise their shields. The Kingsguard behind them level their sonic spears over their comrades' shoulders, and on Black Panther's command, fire at the approaching monsters. The Winter Soldier uses his M-249 machine gun, and Bruce fires the Hulkbuster's hand repulsors.]\nSam Wilson: [Sending Redwings into the fight as he flies, swooping to fire at them with his Steyr pistols] You seen the teeth on those things?\nJames Rhodes: Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. [He flies over the heaviest concentration of Outriders and drops a barrage of mines, all exploding fantastically.]\n[Everyone notices a pack of Outriders starting to run around the force-field to the right of the defenders' position.]\nBruce Banner: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us... there's nothing between them and Vision.\nSteve Rogers: [Grimly] Them we better keep 'em in front of us.\nOkoye: [To the Black Panther] How do we do that?\nKing T'Challa: We open the barrier. [Putting his comm to his mouth] On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.\nDome Control: [Nervous and unsure] Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?\nKing T'Challa: On my signal.\nM'Baku: [To Okoye] This will be the end of Wakanda.\nOkoye: Then it will be the noblest ending in history.\n[Captain America readies one of his Vibranium hand guards. The Black Panther shouts a command in Xhosa; the Border Tribesmen disengage their shields and stand, as the Black Panther walks out in front of them, never taking his eyes off the enemy.]\nKing T'Challa: WAKANDA FOREVER! [He crosses his arms in the Wakandan salute and closes his Black Panther helmet, charging for the barrier. The heroes and leaders are at the fore of the charge. Halfway to the barrier, the Black Panther shouts into his comm] Now!\n[The Outriders pour through, distracted from trying to find any other access. The Black Panther and Captain America pull ahead rapidly due to their enhancements, and literally leap into battle.]\nKing T'Challa: [Over his comm] How much longer, Shuri?\nShuri: We've barely begun, brother. [A delicate and intricate construction of gold light hovers at her eye level; as she manipulates it, the waldo tools reproduce her commands on the Mind Stone itself.]\nKing T'Challa: You might want to pick up the pace.\n[Simultaneously, Thor prepares to open the iris of Nidavellir.]\nThor: Allfathers, give me strength.\nEitri: You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.\nThor: Only if I die. [Takes deep breaths.]\nEitri: [Boggled] Yes. That's what... \"killing you\" means.\n[Thor grasps the two levers and pulls them down and towards himself, slowly opening the iris. The stream of stellar energy blasts pasts him and into the forge once again.]\nEitri: Hold it! Hold it, Thor!\n[Eitri watches the metal ingots melt while Thor is looking increasingly charred. Finally, Eitri is able to tip the cauldron, pouring the metal into the mold just as Thor passes out. The jet carries him into the forge, Rocket follows hastily and landing after Thor bounces limply off a structure to land on the floor. Groot finally looks up from his game at the thump Thor's body makes.]\nRocket: [Kneeling over Thor] Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? [Thor looks far from \"okay\".]\n[Eitri clumsily and urgently pulls the mold, still glowing red-hot, onto the floor, breaking it loose from its frame, then starts punching the mold itself with his metal fists to free the ax.]\nRocket: I think he's dying!\nEitri: He needs the ax! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!\n[Stormbreaker's two sections -- the hammer and the ax-blade -- lay glowing on the floor. Groot looks sadly at Thor, then scowls with determination. He stands, and extends his fingers towards Stormbreaker, growing them at extraordinary speed. As he twines them around the two parts, he cries out at the burning pain but does not hesitate, slamming them together and locking them permanently into one structure. He raises it above his head, and with a mighty cry, chops his extended arm with his other hand to sever it at the right length.Thor's fingers twitch, and the new weapon levitates in a crackle of lightning echoed by the sparks between Thor's fingers.]\n[The remaining Avengers and Wakandans are struggling against the Outriders. The Winter Soldier goes down, and fights off Outrider fangs snapping at his head. Captain America and the Black Panther still fight side-by-side. War Machine hovers over the breach, pouring ammunition into the flood of bodies until a huge hammer -- Cull Obsidian's -- knocks him out of the sky and to the ground. The Hulkbuster is dogpiled and pinned.]\nBruce Banner: There\u2019s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!\n[Suddenly, a large beam of rainbow-hued light lands in the middle of the action, and an ax flies out of it, wreathed with lightning and tearing through the Outriders, freeing the heroes. It flies back to the light and into its master's hand just as the beam cuts out, revealing Thor, Groot and Rocket [The Avengers theme swelling triumphantly at their arrival] who chambers a round in his large gun. Black Widow, Captain America and the Black Panther pause in astonishment. Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian pause in apprehension.]\nBruce Banner: [Opening the Hulkbuster's helm and laughing with joy] AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!\nThor:  BRING ME THANOS! [He charges toward the hordes of Outriders, followed by Groot and Rocket, lightning gathering around him until he finally launches himself into the air, lands in the densest concentration of Outriders and makes a crater where they had stood.]\n[Cut to Titan, where Thanos arrives, finding only fresh debris from Ebony Maw's ship.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Sitting on what may have been plaza steps once] Oh, yeah, you're much more of a \"Thanos.\"\nThanos: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.\nDr. Stephen Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.\nThanos: And where do you think he brought you? [Star-Lord crouches behind wreckage with his weapon ready, behind Thanos and to his left; Spider-Man peeks from above and behind Doctor Strange.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: Let me guess. Your home?\nThanos: [Smiling reminiscently] It was. And it was beautiful. [Thanos curls his gauntleted fist and activates the Reality Stone to show Strange Titan before it was destroyed -- green lawns, intact buildings, water-filled ponds, strolling citizens, the jack-like structures hovering and connected to the ground-based buildings with beams of energy.] Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Genocide.\nThanos: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. [He relaxes his fist; the Stone stops glowing and the illusion fades back into the true state of Titan.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Sarcastically] Congratulations. You're a prophet.\nThanos: I'm a survivor.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Who wants to murder trillions.\nThanos: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy.\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Stands] And then what?\nThanos: I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.\nDr. Stephen Strange: [He summons his Mandalas, entering a fighting pose] I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours.\nThanos: Ours? [He looks up to a see a chunk of wreckage descending rapidly on him, too rapidly to react -- and powered by Iron Man. He is subsequently crushed by it.]\nTony Stark: [Flying in] Piece of cake, Quill.\nPeter Quill: [Triggers his mask and follows] Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!\n[The wreckage on top of Thanos erupts in purple, as he bellows in rage. He turns the hovering fragments into a flock of bats with the Reality Stone and swarms Iron Man with them, driving him back through the ruins.]\n[Spider-Man webs his eyes, and swings in to kick him in the face at the same time that Drax leaps from cover, blades in both hands, to knee-slide behind Thanos and try for a tendon slide across the back of the Titan's knee.]\n[Doctor Strange jumps through a portal and summons a sword of golden energy, dueling with Thanos while Drax attacks similarly on his other side. Thanos punches Drax through a ruined wall, then shatters the blade with one hand and tears the web from his eyes. He advances on Doctor Strange and kicks at him, but Strange's shield absorbs the damage -- the Cloak lifts him free of the ground.]\n[Star-Lord has been making his way back on the ground, and shoots Thanos from behind. Thanos uses the Power Stone to shoot balls of energy at Star-Lord while Star-Lord leaps towards Thanos using magical platforms thrown in his path by Doctor Strange, the last one placed above Thanos' head so Star-Lord can flip over him and slap a mine on Thanos' back. Star-Lord sticks his landing, he disengages his helmet, flips Thanos a bird and falls backward into a portal.]\nPeter Quill: Boom!\n[The explosion knocks Thanos to his knees and dazes him briefly.]\nDr. Stephen Strange: [Whispers to the Cloak of Levitation] Do not let him close his fist. [The Cloak swoops off Doctor Strange's shoulders and wraps itself tightly around Thanos' armored hand, who starts tugging at this unexpected wrapping.]\n[Doctor Strange starts throwing portals everywhere. Spider-Man leaps through one on Thanos' left]\nPeter Parker: Magic! [He punches Thanos in the head and vanishes through a portal to the lower right before reappearing above Thanos] More magic! [He yanks Thanos' head down hard, then leaps into a portal in front of him. He leaps through another portal high and behind Thanos] Magic with a kick! [Delivers a flying kick and falls feet-first into an exit, then appears on his right] Magic with a--\n[Before he can finish Thanos turns, grabbing him from the air, and throwing him to the ground, with his hand around his neck.]\nThanos: Insect!\n[He then throws him at Doctor Strange, knocking them both down. Thanos finally tears the Cloak away and is then promptly surrounded by fiery explosions as Iron Man bombards him. He sucks all the flame into the gauntlet with the Power Stone and fires it in a stream at Iron Man, hitting him dead on and sending him far away, plowing through a massive fallen machine.]\n[Spider-Man leaps from behind, more conventionally this time, while Thanos concentrates his fire on Iron Man, webs the gauntlet and drops down in front of him, pulling hard -- but Thanos yanks on the web-line, pulling the much lighter teenager towards him, and punching him on his way past. He tears the webbing free of the gauntlet just in time for a small spaceship to attempt to crash-land on him.]\n[The ship drags Thanos along for a distance, burying him under debris. He stands just as the pilot leaps in a great arc to punch him, landing in front of him with an energy-blade at the ready.]\nThanos: Well, well.\nNebula: You should have killed me.\nThanos: Would've been a waste of parts!\nNebula: [She runs at Thanos, attacking him with her sword] Where's Gamora?!\n[Thanos punches her away. Doctor Strange uses the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to pinion the gauntlet, pulling Thanos' fingers open and trying to pry the gauntlet off his hand.]\n[Thanos tries to pull free, as Drax slides in from his right, kicking his knee and knocking him off-balance, then wrapping himself around Thanos' kneeling leg.]\n[Star-Lord shoots a electric trap onto the ground to Thanos' right, the tangle-field holding down his unarmored hand.]\n[Spider-Man swings in, webs Thanos' chest then wraps it around behind him, digging his Iron Spider legs into the ground to anchor himself.]\n[Doctor Strange opens a portal straight above Thanos' out of which drops Mantis, landing on the Titan's shoulders, her hands on his temples. He bellows as she tries to put him under.]\n[Iron Man, having returned, is pulling on the gauntlet. Doctor Strange reapplies the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to reinforce the trap's hold on Thanos' right hand, and the Cloak helps him pull. Thanos is finally subdued enough to incapacitate, not fully asleep.]\nTony Stark: [While pulling] Is he under? Don't let up.\nMantis: [Starting to cry] Be quick. He is very strong.\nTony Stark: Parker, help! Get over here. [Spider-Man drops his web-line, and hurries to help Tony with the gauntlet] She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.\nPeter Quill: [Flies over to join the others, stands in front of Thanos, tauntingly] I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?\nThanos: My... Gamora...?\nPeter Quill: No, bullshit. Where is she?\nMantis: [Shocked] He is in anguish.\nPeter Quill: Good.\nMantis: [Crying] He\u2026 he\u2026 mourns.\nDrax: What does this monster have to mourn?!\nNebula: Gamora.\nPeter Quill: [Pause] What?\nNebula: [Realizing with horror and sadness what has happened] He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.\nTony Stark: [Frasps the danger immediately and de-helmets] Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?\n[Quill slowly turns to Thanos,]\nTony Stark: [Shouting his pleads desperately] Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!\nPeter Quill: Tell me she's lying. [Enraged] ASSHOLE! Tell me you didn't do it!\nThanos: I... had... to.\nPeter Quill: [While starting to tear up; quietly] No, you didn't\u2026\u00a0! No, you didn't\u2026\u00a0! [He continues to rage and then pistol-whipping Thanos twice in the face, causing Mantis to let go in pain.] NO, YOU DIDN'T!\nTony Stark and Drax: Quill!\n[Iron Man leaps for Star-Lord's arm, re-helmeting and leaving Spider-Man to pull off the gauntlet.]\nTony Stark: [To the struggling Star-Lord] Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!\nPeter Parker: It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! [Getting the fingers completely loose] I got it! I got it....\u00a0!\n[Thanos wakes completely, now well and truly furious. He head-butts Mantis, grabbing the cuff of the gauntlet just as it is sliding off his hand, causing Spider-Man to stumble back, and then throwing Mantis away off his shoulders.]\nPeter Parker: [Seeing Mantis with far too much air under her] Oh, God. [He jumps and wraps his arms and legs around her, extending his spider legs to form a roll cage for a safe landing.]\n[Thanos kicks Drax off his right leg and into Nebula and Star-Lord, knocking them down. He yanks on the Crimson Bands holding his right hand to throw Doctor Strange far away, and swats away Iron Man and his repulsor shots. The remaining Guardians jump up and charge him again, but he fires a pulse of indigo energy at them that knocks the three of them completely unconscious.]\n[Iron Man zooms back in, his nanite arm cannon manifested, and is head-butted to the ground. Thanos looks at him for a beat, then raises the gauntlet towards Titan's moon. Iron Man stares, aghast. Thanos uses a combination of the Power and Space Stones to shatter the moon's surface, then bring the debris down on the field of battle at speed. Iron Man powers out of the way but is caught by a chunk of moon about the size of a baseball field, slamming him into the ground. The Guardians go sailing into the air from the rebound.]\n[Back in Wakanda, Shuri is working steadily to complete the Mind Stone's removal; Wanda stands by tensely]\n[The Kingsguard, Borderers and Jabari have little success going against Cull Obsidian's chained hammer -- he either sends them flying or punches them into the ground. The Black Panther gets free of his other sorties, leaps and uses all his collected kinetic energy behind a punch that lays Obsidian flat.]\nRocket: [Having found a clear spot] Come and get some, space dogs! [Another wave of Outriders heads right for the raccoon-oid. The Winter Soldier, having come up behind Rocket, grabs him with his mechanical arm, holds him at arms length and spins 540 degrees, firing his own M-249 at the same time.] Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some! [The Winter Soldier drops Rocket, who looks up at him with an impressed gleam] How much for the gun?\nBucky Barnes: [Snaps off another burst] Not for sale.\nRocket: Okay, how much for the arm? [The Winter Soldier just gives him a look and moves off] Oh, I'll get that arm.\n[The tides of battle cause Thor, using Stormbreaker to great effect, and Captain America together. They take a breather.]\nSteve Rogers: [Panting] New haircut?\nThor: [Grinning] Notice you've copied my beard.\n[Captain America nods, wearily gesturing at his own face with a shield-covered hand. Groot skewers three Outriders with his right arm.]\nThor: By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree. [Gestures towards Groot with Stormbreaker]\nGroot: [In full battle snarl] I am GROOT!\nSteve Rogers: [Formally, but bemused] I... I am Steve Rogers.\n[In Shuri's lab, a deep rumbling can be heard even at their height. Wanda looks down on the battlefield, and sees movement through the blazing forest between the troopships and the dome. When the disturbance reaches the edge of the trees, it turns into vast moving mounds of earth that easily bypass the force field and emerge -- Threshers, sets of massive, motorized spiked wheels, intended for nothing more than shredding everything in their paths.]\nKing T'Challa: Fall back! Fall back now!\n[Wanda watches as at least one set of Threshers separates into individual wheels and starts veering all over the battlefield, and then looks anxiously back at Vision]\nJames Rhodes: Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.\nSam Wilson: I'm doing it. [The two fliers use their firepower to crack a Thresher but cannot find a weak spot.]\n[Black Widow with her escrima sticks and Okoye with her augmented spear have drifted together when they're suddenly in the path of a Thresher. Both women cringe at their seemingly inevitable shredding when the Scarlet Witch lands in front of both of them, eyes glowing red, lifting the whole Thresher well clear of the ground. Looking behind her, the friendly forces have scattered and replaced by a charging mob of Outriders -- the perfect place to throw a Thresher. Black Widow straightens with a pleased smile, Okoye with an amazed look.]\nOkoye: [A touch indignant] Why was she up there all this time?\n[The Children of Thanos help answer that question.]\nProxima Midnight: She's on the field. Take it.\n[Corvus Glaive kills one of the guards just outside the lab, alerting Shuri to the problem. She starts hastily disconnecting her equipment from Vision's systems; he gasps at the sensations. The Dora Milaje engages Glaive but is sent skidding across the floor. Shuri finishes her shutdown, grabs one of her sonic panther-paws and fires at Glaive. The Dora attacks again, and Glaive sends both her and Shuri through the balcony railing and onto the main lab floor.]\n[Vision is not where Corvus Glaive expects to find him. Vision is, in fact, charging at him and knocking him out the window to fall many meters down the face of Mount Bashenga.]\nSam Wilson: Guys, we got a Vision situation here. [He's tackled by a leaping Outrider and grounded.]\nSteve Rogers: Somebody get to Vision!\nBruce Banner: I got him! [Bruce has figured out the Hulkbusters repulsor thrusters and makes a beeline for the android.]\nWanda Maximoff: On my way. [She is clobbered by Proxima Midnight's pommel and rolls down into the large ditch from the Thresher before she can move.]\nProxima Midnight: [Jumping down next to the Scarlet Witch] He'll die alone. As will you.\nNatasha Romanoff: She's not alone.\n[Okoye silently brandishes her spear on the other side of Proxima and nods at Black Widow.]\nProxima Midnight: Euuyaaah! [She leaps for Black Widow, who has joined her sticks into a full staff. She blocks Proxima's blow with an electrical crackle while Okoye runs around the slope to also attack from the front.]\n[Corvus Glaive kicks Vision, knocking him down; as he attempts to rise again, Cull Obsidian shows up and swings his hammer in a full arc, throwing Vision even further. He painfully starts to climb to his feet again when a whooshing overhead interrupts the fight as Bruce Banner lands the Hulkbuster between the aliens and the android. He takes a defensive stance, pointing one hand's repulsor at each.]\nBruce Banner: Oh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-- [Cull Obsidian jumps forward, grabs Bruce's right arm and Bruce in reflex grabs Obsidian's hammer; a jet fires, taking the two of them in a random direction, to the base of a waterfall.]\nBruce Banner: Guys! Vision needs backup now! [Obsidian pulls the Hulkbuster up and kicks it in the small of the back.] [Trying to change into the Hulk while fighting Cull Obsidian in the Hulkbuster armor] Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. [Bruce extends his left hand protectively; Obsidian grabs the armor's hand, chops the shoulder joint with a relatively small axe then does a roll over Bruce's back to leverage snapping off the Hulkbuster's whole arm] Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK!\nHulk: [Banner's face briefly becomes the Hulk] NOOOO!!!\nBruce Banner: Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself! [To Obsidian] Come on!\n[He charges the alien, jumps into the air and delivers an effective punch with his remaining hand -- swat, punch, hammer -- except that blow is caught by Obsidian, who punches back, knocking Bruce flat. Obsidian changes his left hand armor into a pointed weapon, and lunges forward to deliver a likely fatal blow, when Bruce grabs the detached Hulkbuster arm out of the water, holding it so Obsidian impales that instead, and slaps the controls.]\nBruce Banner: See ya! [The repulsors fire, taking Cull Obsidian high into the air -- high enough, in fact, to intersect the defense dome. The Hulkbuster arm drags Obsidian against the field to grotesque destructive effect, ending in a very final explosion.] Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.\n[Proxima Midnight alternates heavy blows between her two opponents, but all three of them duck as a single-wheel Thresher tears overhead, the ditch sparing them most of the danger from the wheel-blades. Proxima uses the distraction to kick Black Widow in the face, sending her to the ground. She then grabs Okoye by the shoulder and weapon and throws her meters away.]\n[Simultaneously, Corvus Glaive and Vision struggle in the forest at the foot of Mount Bashenga. Glaive grasps Vision's shoulder and uses the leverage to plunge his blade once more into the android's chest.]\nCorvus Glaive: I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man. [He yanks his blade out, and Vision collapses. As he bends over his fallen opponent to retrieve the Stone, he's tackled by Captain America at full speed.]\nSteve Rogers: Get outta here! [He exchanges blows with Glaive, using his arm-shields as offence as well as defense, then turns to Vision again] GO!\n[Black Widow splits her staff back into a pair of sticks to block Proxima Midnight's sword blows, and finally knocks it from her hand. The alien takes to her bare fists instead, knocks down and pins the Black Widow. Proxima triggers an arm-blade from her left-arm armor, and stabs at Black Widow, who barely manages to block the blade with her crossed sticks. As the edge starts to dig into Black Widow's neck anyway, scarlet energy grabs the alien and tosses her into the air right into the path of another passing Thresher. Dark blue blood spatters the women below. The Scarlet Witch sits up, sighing with relief, her hands still shimmering.]\nNatasha Romanoff: That was really gross.\n[Captain America keeps blocking Corvus Glaive's staff weapon using his shields, finally knocking it from the alien's hands just before he's thrown over a fallen tree and pinned, Glaive's hand at his throat. Even with his physical abilities, Captain America's struggling -- until a glaive-blade pierces Glaive's chest, and is pushed all the way through. Vision raises his enemy in a perfect mirror of the first attack on him, and holds him for a moment, before dropping Glaive's corpse to one side and collapsing exhaustively.]\nSteve Rogers: [helping him back up] I thought I told you to go.\nVision: We don't trade lives, Captain.\n[The remaining Guardians and Avengers are dealing with the gravitic aftermath of dumping a large chunk of moon onto an unstable planet's surface. The unconscious Guardians are flying upwards uncontrollably, moon-chunks are still making fiery ballistic in-bounds, and random debris and massive rocks are floating in any possible direction. Spider-Man is well-equipped to handle this physically, even if he's freaking out emotionally.]\nPeter Parker: [Webs Mantis] I got you! I got you! [Snags Drax, securing both of them to something not moving] I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names! [Reels in Star-Lord]\n[The Cloak of Levitation sets Doctor Strange down on a relatively stable outcrop as Thanos extricates himself from rubble. The Sorcerer Supreme makes a few passes with his hands, producing the familiar golden magic filigree circles, and slams his hands down on the rock before him, invoking the Seven Suns of Cinnibus as a lightning-like effect of immense heat jumping from rock to rock until it reaches Thanos, sending him flying -- but he makes use of the erratic gravity to keep control and fire back a blast from the Power Stone.]\n[Doctor Strange blocks the purple plume with a wall of Mirror Dimension, which he then pushes back at Thanos. It shatters around the Titan, who suctions the magic into a miniature black hole with the Space Stone, volleying it back at Doctor Strange. Just in time, Doctor Strange raises a shield and changes the dark energy into a swarm of aqua butterflies which return to their master.]\n[Before Thanos can counterattack again, Doctor Strange levitates and invokes the Images of Ikonn, giving him arms like a Hindu deity before dozens of Strange replications rush away, forming a circular wall around a snarling Thanos. They call cast magical cords, wrapping around Thanos' torso, arms and hands; he struggles to close his gauntleted fist, and uses the Soul and Power Stones to discover the real Doctor Strange among the many copies, blowing the duplicates away and sending the singular Doctor Strange reeling. Reality and Space pull Doctor Strange forward, Thanos grasping him by the throat once in range. Doctor Strange grabs futilely at Thanos' hand.]\nThanos: You're full of tricks, wizard.\nDr. Stephen Strange: [as Thanos reaches for the Eye of Agamotto] No!\nThanos: [He snaps the Eye off its chain] Yet you never once used your greatest weapon. [He crushes it in his bare hand] A fake. [He throws Doctor Strange hard enough that Doctor Strange's head hits stone and he passes out.]\n[Almost simultaneously, a red and gold device slaps into the palm of the Infinity Gauntlet, bracing the fingers open; and a red and gold Avenger makes a fast and hard entrance.]\nTony Stark: [sounding just about done with the Titan] You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it.\nThanos: Stark.\nTony Stark: You know me?\nThanos: I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.\nTony Stark: My only curse is you. [Small rockets pop out of Iron Man's back and launch at Thanos.]\nThanos: Come on!\n[The rockets all explode on target, momentarily shrouding Thanos in smoke. Before it clears, Iron Man pile drives into Thanos horizontally, using his single super-jet boot configuration. As he bounces off, he flips and sticks his landing, immediately re-configuring his boots into ground clamps for stability and his gloves into rocket-driven battering rams, punching Thanos into a ruined wall behind him.]\n[Thanos shakes it off quickly, reaches forward and tears Iron Man's helmet off, revealing Tony's surprised expression before the suit recovers automatically and re-forms his head protection. The Titan makes use of the fractional delay and punches back hard, sending Iron Man sliding meters away, giving Thanos time to rip the brace device off the gauntlet. He immediately uses the Power Stone to stream furiously lambent energy at his opponent, who forms a shield to kneel behind just as instantly, getting pushed back even further by the incredible force.]\n[Iron Man slides out from behind the shield, letting the angled energy push him away for a faster start, and whips back to Thanos full thrusters; he kicks at the Titan with his left foot, turning the boot into a ground clamp at the same time to pin the gauntlet, and keeps twisting while his left glove becomes a ram again, slamming into Thanos' face, cutting his cheek.]\nThanos: [Panting] All that for a drop of blood.\n[He smiles briefly punches Iron Man, sending him pinwheeling, then starts beating him with his fists. Iron Man attempts to block the blows with his forearms, but Thanos is relentless, picking him up by the helmet and blasting his midsection with the Power Stone. The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony's head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what's left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony's left side. The fight is over.]\n[Thanos walks Tony back until he sits, and places the gauntlet almost comfortingly on Tony's head.]\nThanos: You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive. [He lets go, straightens and steps back] I hope they remember you.\n[Tony's just a little distracted with the pain, and blood drooling out of his mouth, and compromised breathing.]\n[Thanos raises the gauntlet, closing his fist, all four Stones glowing]\nDr. Stephen Strange: Stop! [Sitting up and sounding entirely damaged] Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.\nThanos: No tricks. [Doctor Strange shakes his head as Thanos points all four Stones at him instead.]\nTony Stark: Don't...\u00a0!\n[Doctor Strange reaches up and plucks the Time Stone out of its hiding place in the stars. He opens his hand, the scars on his fingers and their inherent trembling particularly obvious now, and the Stone floats to Thanos' bare hand. Doctor Strange watches him intently, as he takes the Stone and drops it into the thumb setting, the energy pulse making the Titan wince.]\nThanos: One to go. [An energy blast hits the gauntlet right in the empty Mind Stone setting, and Thanos grimaces in surprise.]\nPeter Quill: [Screaming in incoherent rage, helmet up, firing with both hands and flying straight for Thanos.]\n[Thanos doesn't even bother responding to the assault -- he just leaves. Star-Lord flies through where Thanos had been and crashes, rolling several times]\nPeter Quill: [Standing and de-helmeting] Where is he?!\n[Tony stitches up his stab wound as well as he can with his suit functions; he has no breath for answers.]\nPeter Quill: [Now fearful instead of furious] Did we just lose?\nTony Stark: [To Doctor Strange, sadly, who has given the Time Stone to Thanos] Why would you do that?\nDoctor Strange: We're in the Endgame now.\n[M'Baka bashes another Outrider -- the ground game has improved considerably with the addition of the God of Thunder. His tribesmen are equally successful around him.]\nM'Baku: MAYEFA!\nJabari: YA HU!\n[Thor is in the air, using Stormbringer on the Outrider drop ships which are now retreating. He is having considerably more success than the Wakandan Dragon fliers firing on the fleeing ships.]\nWanda Maximoff: [landing as she finally locates Vision] Are you okay? [Vision flinches in pain before he can answer] What? What is it?\nVision: He's here.\n[The wind picks up. It feels... strange. Eerie.]\nSteve Rogers: Everyone, on my position. We have incoming. [He is joined by the Black Widow, Falcon, Okoye and the Black Panther in short order.]\nNatasha Romanoff: What the hell?\nBruce Banner: [Bruce sees the blue-black clouds of a Space Stone relocation just before Thanos steps forward, and confirms this isn't just another member of the Black Order] Cap. That's him.\nSteve Rogers: Eyes up. Stay sharp.\n[Bruce reaches Thanos first, lunging forward fist-first -- but Thanos uses the Space Stone on him, renders him immaterial until the Hulkbuster is half-buried in the stone of the cliff behind him, and freezes Bruce in place.]\n[Captain America is sent flying by purple energy before he even gets to strike a single blow.]\n[The Black Panther, armor fully charged kinetically, leaps high and with claws extended, but is easily grabbed by the throat and punched to the ground, his armor discharging violently.]\n[Falcon stoops, strafing with both Steyr pistols, but is felled when his wings become rubbery and unable to sustain flight.]\nVision: Wanda. It's time.\nWanda Maximoff: No.\nVision: They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.\nWanda Maximoff: Don't.\nVision: You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time.\nWanda Maximoff: I can't.\nVision: Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.\nWanda Maximoff: It's not fair.\nVision: It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. [The Scarlet Witch extends a trembling hand and starts beaming her energy at the Mind Stone.]\n[The following action is mostly muted. War Machine joins the fight, firing his guns at Thanos until he uses the gauntlet to crush his armor around him and toss him aside.]\n[The Winter Soldier runs in firing, and is punched away by the Power Stone.]\n[Okoye activates the Vibranium-powered elements on her spear and flings it; Power stops it inches from Thanos, and throws her and it aside while wrapping the Black Widow in inescapable bands of earth.]\n[Groot stabs his hands into the ground to wrap Thanos in cables of roots, which he breaks easily.]\n[The Scarlet Witch watches all this over one shoulder, and turns back to Vision to add her left hand to her tearful effort.]\n[Captain America slides under one blow and comes up swinging his deployed arm-shields, punching Thanos in the gut and chin. He grabs the gauntlet, keeping Thanos' fingers un-clenched. Thanos looks very briefly impressed at Captain America's efforts as he screams before slamming a fist into his head and rendering him insensible.]\n[The Scarlet Witch looks over her shoulder again and sees Thanos approaching unopposed. She swings her left hand around to fend him off with a stream of scarlet energy, and pushes him back despite his blue-purple energy shield, but then he starts to make slow headway.]\nVision: [Very softly] It's all right. It's all right. I love you.\n[At those words, the yellow Mind Stone finally starts to crack. Vision's face is overcome by an expression of joyful peace, and as the crystal fragments completely, a pulse of pure yellow energy explodes from him, shuddering the trees for many meters around his epicenter. Wanda's and Thanos' energy subsides.]\nThanos: [Walking closer to the Scarlet Witch] I understand, my child. Better than anyone.\nWanda Maximoff: [Snarls] You could never.\nThanos: [Reaches down to presume to stroke her hair, as if in comfort] Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. [He reaches forward, clenching the gauntlet, emerald filigree surrounding his wrist, making a gesture very similar to that Doctor Strange made when activating the Eye of Agamotto. In response, a bead of yellow light starts gathering in on itself as time is reversed and growing in size, solidifying into an intact and conscious Vision]\nWanda Maximoff: No! [She lunges for Vision and is swatted away.]\n[Thanos picks up Vision by the throat, lifting him to eye-level, and digs the fingers of his right hand into Vision's forehead, digging out the Mind Stone. He pulls it loose, and Vision goes limp and colorless; he tosses the lifeless android aside like trash. Bringing his gauntleted hand up, he slowly moves the Mind Stone over the last empty setting, and drops it in. The energy surge is much more than any previous -- his torso is wreathed with iridescent static and he bellows from the sensations.]\n[As Thanos studies the completed gauntlet, a massive bolt of lighting strikes him, digging him into the ground and grinding him back for meters. Thor has arrived, eyes glowing with power, stooping down from the sky like a bird of prey. The God of Thunder pauses his attack, reverses his position, raises Stormbreaker above his head and hurls it -- Thanos fires the whole might of the gauntlet against it, but it only creates a rainbow-like bow-shock, not slowing the ax as it slams right into Thanos' chest. ]\nThor: [Lands in front of Thanos, who is down on one knee; hatefully.] I told you. You'd die for that!\n[He takes hold of the back of Thanos' head and forces Stormbreaker deeper into his chest, staring angrily into his eyes while Thanos cries out in pain]\nThanos: [Weakly] You should have... you... [suddenly stronger] you should have gone for the head! [He raises his gauntlet and snaps his fingers.]\nThor: NO!\n[The scene whites out. It cuts sharply to a view of Thanos his hand on his chest, no wounds visible. Thanos now seems to be inside the Soul Stone, where he sees a young Gamora and the pavilion from the home world of the Zen-Whoberi.]\nThanos: Daughter?\nGamora: Did you do it?\nThanos: Yes.\nGamora: [Beat] What did it cost?\nThanos: [Solemnly] Everything.\n[Now out of the Soul World, Thanos is snapped back to normal reality, and notices the damage inflicted on the gauntlet -- the metal scorched and distorted from heat, the stones no longer glowing.]\nThor: What'd you do? [Angrily] WHAT'D YOU DO?!\n[Thanos nearly seems to not notice Thor before he uses the Space Stone and teleports away, leaving Stormbreaker behind on Wakandan ground.]\nSteve Rogers: [Stumbles into the clearing, holding his left side] Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?\nBucky Barnes: Steve?\n[Bucky suddenly stumbles over, and collapses into ashes, much to Steve's shock; he walks over and touches the ground where Bucky's ashes evaporated disbelievingly.]\n[On the battlefield, Wakandan soldiers disintegrate to ashes, much to M'Baku's horror.]\nKing T'Challa: [While reaching for a fallen Okoye] Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. [King T'Challa holds out his hand for Okoye. He suddenly disintegrates into ashes and, in anguish, Okoye falls back on the ground.]\nOkoye: Kumkani?!\nGroot: [Slowly corrodes into ashes as well by Rocket] I am Groot...\nRocket: No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no...\n[Wanda is mourning over Vision. She then turns into ashes. An injured Sam turns to ashes, hidden in the undergrowth.]\nJames Rhodes: [Searching for Sam, missing him by only a few feet] Sam? Sam!? Where you at?!\n[On Titan, the remaining members of the Guardians and Avengers collect themselves -- Mantis props up Star-Lord, Spider-Man helps Tony to his feet, Drax and Nebula manage to limp over on their own.]\nMantis: Something... is... happening. [She disintegrates into ashes.]\nDrax: [To Quill as he dissolves] Quill?\n[Quill stares in horror.]\nTony Stark: [Staring panicked at the slowly fading Quill] Steady, Quill.\nPeter Quill: Aw, man. [Quill also gets disintegrated into ashes]\nDoctor Strange: [Calmly turns to Stark] Tony, there was no other way. [He finally gets erased.]\nPeter Parker: [Realizes he's fading away] Mr. Stark? I don't feel so good...\nTony Stark: [Trying to be calm, his voice shaking as he looks at Peter in terror] You're all right.\nPeter Parker: [Stumbling and terrified] I don't know what's -- I don't know what's happening. I don't-- [Parker falls into Stark's arms, clutching him tight while beginning to cry.] I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mr. Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... [There is a short silence before Peter speaks again] I'm sorry. [Parker disintegrates into ashes in Stark's arms.]\n[Tony falls forward from the lack of weight in his arms, before staring at his hands in disbelief.]\nNebula: [To Tony Stark, seeing Thanos' victory.] He did it.\n[Stark mourns silently at their failure. Back on Wakanda, the remaining team members, Captain America, Thor, War Machine, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, and Rocket are left mourning near Vision's dead body. Captain America turns over Vision's bleached corpse as Black Widow runs up to the other survivors.]\nJames Rhodes: What is this? What the hell is happening?\nSteve Rogers: [Pause] Oh, God.\n[Meanwhile, in a different place, in a rustic house on a terraced slope with a scarecrow made of discarded armor, Thanos sits down and watches the sun rise.]\n\nNick Fury: Still no word from Stark?\nMaria Hill: No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. [Receives three beeps from her device.]\nNick Fury: What is it?\nMaria Hill: Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.\nNick Fury: Same energy signatures as New York?\nMaria Hill: Ten times bigger.\nNick Fury: Tell Klein. We'll meet him at- -\nMaria Hill: Nick! [A car spirals out of control in front of them. They get out and Hill checks on the passengers.]\nNick Fury: They okay?\n[Behind their vehicle, a motorcycle lies in the middle of the street with a concerned citizen approaching it.]\nMaria Hill: There's no one here.\n[They hear helicopter rotor sounds from the direction they'd come, but it sounds wrong -- a Leonardo executive helicopter, tail rotor smoking from damage already, appears and crashes nose-first into a building. Screaming intensifies. The two are now witnessing civilians around them suddenly disintegrating.]\nNick Fury: Call Control. Code Red.\nMaria Hill: Nick?\n[Fury turns around to see Hill disintegrating.]\nNick Fury: Hill?\n[Fury then races back to their car and gets a what appears to be an old pager with extra gear attached out of his bag on the back seat. He sends out an emergency alert, mere seconds before his hand turns into ashes.]\nNick Fury: Motherfu--\n[Fury corrodes to dust. The pager falls to the ground, red lights blinking on the additions; the camera zooms in and we see the device display \"SENDING...\" then display a red-blue-and-gold star insignia -- the symbol of Captain Marvel.]\n\n\n[Screen title: Thanos will return]\n\n\n\n"

She looks around.]\n Steve Rogers: [on radio] All right, what do you see?\n Wanda Maximoff: Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It\u2019s a good target.\n Steve Rogers: There\u2019s an ATM in the south corner, which means . . .\n Wanda Maximoff: Cameras.\n Steve Rogers: Both cross streets are one way.\n Wanda Maximoff: So, compromised escape routes.\n Steve Rogers: Means our guy doesn't care about being seen, he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?\n Wanda Maximoff: Yeah, the red one? It\u2019s cute.\n Natasha Romanoff: [on radio] It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us.\n Wanda Maximoff: You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?\n Natasha Romanoff: Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.\n Sam Wilson: Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?\n Natasha Romanoff: Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?\n Steve Rogers: Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him.\n Sam Wilson: If he sees us coming that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.\n [A garbage truck is pushing its way through traffic, with no regard to pedestrians or other vehicles]\n Steve Rogers: Sam, see that garbage truck? Tag it.\n [From the back of Sam\u2019s Falcon jet pack, a small drone, Redwing, launches and flies down to scan the garbage truck.]\n Sam Wilson: Give me X-ray.\n [Redwing weight analysis: Cargo Weight: 13825 kgs. Max capacity.]\n Sam Wilson: That truck\u2019s loaded for max weight. And the driver\u2019s armed.\n Natasha Romanoff: It\u2019s a battering ram.\n Steve Rogers: Go now.\n Wanda Maximoff: What?\n Steve Rogers: He\u2019s not hitting the police.\n INSTITUTE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES\n [A man is sitting in the guard station. He looks over as the garbage truck comes towards the gate. The driver jumps out, and the truck slams into the guard station. Two trucks rush into the compound through the newly-made hole.]\n [Soldiers in black armor emerge from the trucks, firing their rifles around the courtyard. Four soldiers fire gas canisters into the building. Soldiers wearing gas masks enter.]\n [Steve arrives and takes out several of the soldiers.]\n Steve Rogers: Body armor, AR-15's. I make 7 hostiles.\n [Sam flies in and up to a rooftop, spinning and using his wings to block gunfire. He takes out two soldiers.]\n Sam Wilson: I make 5.\n [Wanda arrives and flies over the rooftop and into the courtyard, blocking fire with her powers. She takes control of one soldier and lifts him upward.]\n Wanda Maximoff: Sam.\n [Sam glides down from the rooftop, catching the soldier on one of his wings.]\n Sam Wilson: Four.\n [Redwing flies by, scanning the inside of the building.]\n Sam Wilson: Rumlow\u2019s on the third floor.\n Steve Rogers: Wanda, just like we practiced.\n Wanda Maximoff: What about the gas?\n Steve Rogers: Get it out.\n [Wanda uses her powers to lift Steve up and through the window. He grabs a soldier and pulls off their gas mask]\n [Rumlow is inside. He uses an attachment to his suit to punch down the door. He knocks aside a technician and enters a room with a vial labeled \"bio-hazard.\"]\n Brock Rumlow: Pack it up.\n [In another area, Steve is behind a pillar, evading gunfire. He throws his shield, and it bounces off the soldier and back to Steve. Meanwhile, Wanda is now using her powers to remove the gas from the building. Sam is exchanging fire with several soldiers.]\n [Rumlow walks outside onto a balcony and sees the havoc Steve\u2019s team has created.]\n Brock Rumlow: He\u2019s here.\n [Inside the building, Steve sees the vial missing.]\n Steve Rogers: Rumlow has a biological weapon.\n [Natasha is riding in on a motorcycle.]\n Natasha Romanoff: (on radio) I\u2019m on it.\n [She jumps off the motorcycle and it skids toward a soldier, taking him out. She runs forward, taking out soldiers through hand-to-hand combat and with her Widow's Bite cuffs. Rumlow comes up behind her and grabs her collar, dragging her onto a car. She fights back, and zaps his neck. No response.]\n Brock Rumlow: I don't work like that no more.\n [He throws her through the roof hatch into an armored vehicle, drops in a grenade, and shuts the hatch.]\n Brock Rumlow: Fire in the hole.\n Mercenary: No!\n [Natasha takes out the soldiers inside, then grabs one to shield herself from the grenade. The doors blow open and she is thrown out. She coughs, but is alive.]\n [Steve runs out onto the balcony and spots Rumlow aiming a mounted grenade launcher. The grenade slams into Steve's shield and he is thrown back inside. He scrambles to his feet as Rumlow fires two more times, throwing him out a window, onto a truck, and finally the ground. He struggles and gets him legs under him.]\n Steve Rogers: Sam. He's in an AFV heading north.\n [Inside the AFV, Rumlow secures the biological weapon and hands it to a soldier.]\n Brock Rumlow: Take this to the airstrip. We're not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck.\n [The truck crashes into a nearby structure and Rumlow and the soldiers emerge.]\n Mercenary #1: Where are you going to meet us?\n Brock Rumlow: I\u2019m not.\n [Sam lands on the roof of a structure. He scans the area with his goggles.]\n Sam Wilson: I got four, they're splitting up.\n [Natasha rides through the crowd, back on her motorcycle. She abandons it again and runs across the hoods of cars, in pursuit.]\n Natasha Romanoff: I got the two on the left.\n [Steve is also running across cars. He spots a vest in the middle of a crowd.]\n Steve Rogers: They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now. One of them has the payload.\n [Someone throws a bomb at Steve. It sticks on his shield. Steve throws it in the air and the bomb detonates safely away from citizens. Rumlow comes up behind Steve and punches him in the back.]\n Brock Rumlow: There you are, you son of a bitch. I\u2019ve been waiting for this!\n [Meanwhile, Sam is still chasing the other mercenaries. Sam flies up and takes out his two, then searches their bags for the payload.]\n Sam Wilson: He doesn't have it. I\u2019m empty.\n [Natasha is chasing the soldiers through the crowd.]\n Natasha Romanoff: Out of the way!\n [She tackles one soldier and engages him in combat. When the other soldier arrives, she hurls a basket at him to distract him. She uses her skills to fight them and ends up face-to-face with one soldier. They point their guns at each other. A moment passes. Then, the other soldier produces the vial.]\n Mercenary #1: Drop it. Or I\u2019ll drop this. Drop it!\n Mercenary #2: He'll do it!\n [Redwing descends and fires at the soldier with the vial. He drops, and in the moment of distraction, Natasha fires at the other soldier, then catches the falling vial.]\n Natasha Romanoff: Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.\n Sam Wilson: Don't thank me.\n Natasha Romanoff: I\u2019m\u2026 not thanking that thing.\n Sam Wilson: His name is Redwing.\n Natasha Romanoff: I'm still not thanking it.\n Sam Wilson: He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.\n [Steve and Rumlow are still fighting, neither one seeming to have the upper hand.]\n Brock Rumlow: Come on!\n [Rumlow pins Steve to a building and extends a blade from one of his gauntlets.]\n Brock Rumlow: This is for dropping a building on my face.\n [Steve grabs Rumlow's arm and pulls the gauntlet off, only for Rumlow to reveal another knife. But Steve bests him. Defeated, on his knees, Rumlow removes his mask, revealing a scarred face.]\n Brock Rumlow: I think I look pretty good, all things considered.\n Steve Rogers: Who's your buyer?\n Brock Rumlow: You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky.\n Steve Rogers: What did you say?\n Brock Rumlow: He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, \"Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go.\" And you're coming with me.\n [He activates his bomb vest and Steve flinches as Rumlow's armor ignites, but Wanda keeps the blast contained around Rumlow who grimaces in agony. She lifts him into the air before she loses control, and the explosion finally blossoms, devastating entire floors of a nearby office building. Wanda sees what happened and covers her mouth in shock.]\n Steve Rogers: Oh my . . . [Steve stares up, open mouthed.] Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.\n\n\n [Soft piano is playing. Tony Stark's mother, Maria, sits at a piano. A young Tony is on the couch.]\n Maria Stark: Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . . [She stops singing as Howard Stark walks in, but continues playing.] Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.\n Howard Stark: Who's the homeless person on the couch?\n [Tony, wearing a Santa hat, staggers to his feet and chuckles.]\n Young Tony Stark: This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.\n Maria Stark: Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.\n Howard Stark: Really, which broad? What's her name?\n Young Tony Stark: Candice.\n [Howard pulls of Tony's hat.]\n Howard Stark: Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.\n Young Tony Stark: Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?\n Maria Stark: You father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.\n Howard Stark: We might have to make a quick stop.\n Young Tony Stark: At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.\n [Maria stops playing the piano.]\n Howard Stark: You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.\n [He walks out of the room, and Maria stands up.]\n Maria Stark: He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.\n [Howard walks back in.]\n Young Tony Stark: I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.\n [Maria leans in to kiss Tony on the cheek, and when she leans back, an older Tony Stark is standing in the background. Howard and Maria walk out, leaving the two Tonys.]\n Tony Stark: That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.\n [He blows on a candle and everything around him shimmers, then starts to dissolve. It's a hologram.]\n Tony Stark: It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . . [He takes off his glasses.] Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.\n [He is standing on a stage in front of a large crowd. A sign reads MIT Alumni Honors: Tony Stark.]\n Tony Stark: Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? \"To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges.\" Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.\n [The crowd chuckles.]\n Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.\n [The crowd breaks out in applause and cheering.]\n Tony Stark: No strings, no taxes\u2026 just re-frame the future! Starting now.\n [The teleprompter above the audience reads. 'Now I would like to introduce the head of the foundation: Pepper Potts.' Tony stares at it sadly.]\n Tony Stark: Go break some eggs.\n [He exits the stage.]\n MIT teacher: Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, \"Ooh, gross,\" but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .\n [Tony is not listening.]\n Tony Stark: Restroom's this way, yeah?\n MIT teacher: Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.\n Stark's Assistant: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.\n Tony Stark: It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.\n MIT teacher: We'll catch up later.\n [Tony steps into a quiet corridor. He loiters by the men's room, then glances back at the stage door before walking towards the elevator. A woman in sober clothes is also waiting. Tony stops and turns his back to the wall.]\n Mrs. Spencer: That was nice, what you did for those young people.\n Tony Stark: Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.\n Mrs. Spencer: They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?\n [He narrows his eyes and half smiles, then turns to face the elevator. He looks surprised to find the button unlit and pushes it himself.]\n Tony Stark: Are you going up?\n Mrs. Spencer: I'm right where I want to be.\n [She digs in her handbag, Tony grabs her wrist. He realizes what he's done.]\n Tony Stark: Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.\n Mrs. Spencer: I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.\n [She shoves a photo at him.]\n Mrs Spencer: His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.\n [Tony shakes his head.]\n Mrs Spencer: Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.\n [She turns and walks away, leaving Tony standing by the elevator with a grim frown.]\n\n\n [At the Avengers Compound. Steve catches Wanda watching a news report on the Lagos attack and how they blame her for it.]\n News Anchor #1: 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.\n King T'Chaka: Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.\n News Anchor #1: The Wakanda king went on to . . .\n [Steve, who was watching the news, turns his computer off, but sound drifts toward him from another room.]\n News anchor #2: They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.\n [Wanda is sitting on her bed, watching the news on her TV.]\n News Anchor #2 What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeri -\n [The TV turns off. Steve sets the remote down and leans on the door frame.]\n Wanda Maximoff: It's my fault.\n Steve Rogers: That's not true.\n Wanda Maximoff: Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.\n Steve Rogers: I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.\n [He walks over.]\n Steve Rogers: Rumlow said \"Bucky\" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. [He sits beside Wanda.]\n Steve Rogers: And people died. It's on me.\n Wanda Maximoff: It's on both of us.\n Steve Rogers: This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved.\n [Vision materializes through the wall. Wanda starts.]\n\n[Vision interrupts Wanda and Steve by walking through the wall into Wanda\u2019s room]\n\n Wanda Maximoff: Vis! We talked about this.\n Vision: Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . . \n [He gestures at the door and stops.]\n Vision: Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.\n Steve Rogers: Thank you. We'll be right down.\n Vision: I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.\n Steve Rogers: We know who it is?\n Vision: The Secretary of State.\n\n\n [The Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross, is standing at the head of a table. Rhodey, Natasha, Steve, Tony, Sam, Vision, and Wanda are gathered around.]\n\n[The Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross has summoned the Avengers to a meeting]\n\n Secretary Ross: Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word \"vigilantes\".\n Natasha Romanoff: And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?\n Secretary Ross: How about \"dangerous\"? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?\n [Ross activates a screen behind him. News footage from past Avengers and SHIELD matters flash on the screen as he speaks.]\n Secretary Ross: New York.\n [A Chitauri leviathan. Terrified citizens. A soldier firing a gun. The Hulk smashes into a building and sends a dust cloud to engulf the camera.]\n [Rhodey looks regretful. He glances behind him at Natasha.]\n Secretary Ross: Washington DC.\n [The three Insight helicarriers, firing on each other. The destroyed Triskelion. A helicarrier crashing into the Potomac and throwing up a massive wave, engulfing citizens and the camera.]\n [Sam looks down.]\n Secretary Ross: Sokovia.\n [Terrified citizens, running. The city rising. A building falling over.]\n [Wanda stares at the screen, as does Tony.]\n Secretary Ross: Lagos.\n [The burning building. Paramedics moving a body. A dead girl.]\n [Wanda is particularly affected by the footage from Lagos. Steve sees this and intervenes.]\n Steve Rogers: Okay. That's enough.\n [Secretary Ross nods to an aide and the images disappear.]\n Secretary Ross: For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. [he places a thick document on the desk and passes it to Wanda]\n [An aide hands him a thick book, which Ross slides across the table to Wanda. She picks it up, then slides it to Rhodey.]\n Secretary Ross: The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary.\n Steve Rogers: The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.\n Secretary Ross: Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?\n [Steve looks up and meets Ross's eyes.]\n Secretary Ross: If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.\n James Rhodes: So, there are contingencies.\n Secretary Ross: Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.\n [Steve glances at Tony.]\n Secretary Ross: Talk it over.\n Natasha Romanoff: And if we come to a decision you don't like?\n Secretary Ross: Then you retire.\n [Natasha stifles a smile.]\n\n\n [Cleveland.]\n [Vasily Karpov sits, eating at the table in a cluttered house. He hears the sound of something crashing outside and peers through drawn blinds. Outside, Helmut Zemo stands by his car, the front end crumpled against Karpov's car.]\n Helmut Zemo: Hello? Is this your car out front?\n [Zemo comes to the door.]\n Helmut Zemo: I jumped the curb.\n [Karpov eyes his gun nearby.]\n Helmut Zemo: Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess.\n Vasily Karpov: No. No cops.\n Helmut Zemo: Thank you.\n [Karpov slides a heavy duty lock and opens the door. Zemo punches him.]\n [Zemo is using a sledgehammer to smash a hole in the wall. He retrieves a large box from inside the hole and tips the contents onto a table. Karpov is hanging upside down, tied to pipes in his basement. There are various documents and the red book with the star on the cover. He holds the red book for a moment then opens a file. Inside is a photo of Karpov in his military uniform and beret.]\n Helmut Zemo: You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations.\n [Karpov's head is in a sink, which is filling with water.]\n Helmut Zemo: \"Mission report: December 16, 1991.\"\n Vasily Karpov: Who are you?\n Helmut Zemo: My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991.\n Vasily Karpov: How did you find me?\n Helmut Zemo: When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those.\n Vasily Karpov: What do you want?\n Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16. 1991.\n Vasily Karpov: Go . . . to . . . hell.\n [Zemo goes to lean on the sink as water continues to flow into it. He turns off the tap and studies Karpov's upside down face.]\n Helmut Zemo: HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.\n [Zemo stares at Karpov then nods resignedly. He turns the tap back on. The water is up to Karpov's eyes. Zemo watches the water level rise.]\n Vasily Karpov: Hail HYDRA.\n [Holding the red book Zemo walks away. Karpov twitches and struggles in his bindings.]\n\n\n [The Avengers are gathered at HQ. Steve is sitting, studying the Accords, while Rhodey and Sam argue behind him.]\n James Rhodes: Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.\n Sam Wilson: So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?\n James Rhodes: A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, \"No, that's cool. We got it. \"\n Sam Wilson: How long are you going to play both sides?\n Vision: I have an equation.\n Sam Wilson: Oh, this will clear it up.\n Vision: In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.\n Steve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?\n Vision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.\n James Rhodes: Boom.\n [Tony is lying on the couch, one hand over his face. When Natasha speaks, he removes the hand to look at her.]\n Natasha Romanoff: Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.\n Steve Rogers: It's because he's already made up his mind.\n Tony Stark: Boy, you know me so well.\n [He gets up and winces, rubbing the back of his head.]\n Tony Stark: Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.\n [He walks to the kitchen and grabs a mug.]\n Tony Stark: That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?\n [He puts his phone in a basket and taps it.The phone projects an image of a smiling young man. He looks down, then back up, and pretends to notice the picture for the first time.]\n Tony Stark: Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.\n [The others look affected by this .]\n Tony Stark: He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. [He takes a pill with some coffee, then faces the others.]\n Tony Stark: There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.\n Steve Rogers: Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.\n Tony Stark: Who said we're giving up?\n Steve Rogers: We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.\n James Rhodes: I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.\n Steve Rogers: No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.\n Tony Stark: That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.\n Steve Rogers: Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.\n Tony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.\n Wanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.\n Vision: We would protect you.\n Natasha Romanoff: Maybe Tony's right.\n [Tony looks at her, surprised.]\n Natasha Romanoff: If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -\n Sam Wilson: Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?\n Natasha Romanoff: I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.\n Tony Stark: Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?\n Natasha Romanoff: Oh, I want to take it back now.\n Tony Stark: No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.\n [Steve's phone buzzes, and he pulls it out to check it. A text message reads: 'She's gone. In her sleep.']\n Steve Rogers: I have to go.\n [Steve gets up sharply, drops the Accords on the coffee table, and goes downstairs. He stops at the bottom of the stairs, leans against the banister, and bows his head.]\n\n\n [London.]\n [A cathedral, packed with mourners. A choir is singing. Steve is one of six pallbearers carrying a coffin draped with the Union Jack. His eyes are red--he's been crying.]\n [At the altar, a candle burns by a framed photograph of Peggy Carter in a military uniform. The label reads \"Margaret 'Peggy' Carter\". The priest addresses the mourners.]\n Priest: And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words.\n [Agent 13, Steve's \"neighbor\" from DC, steps up to the podium.]\n [Steve sits beside Sam in a pew at the front. Steve is looking down and doesn't see Sharon walk up. Sam is watching, and nudges Steve. He looks up to see Sharon, who glances at Steve and takes a breath.]\n Sharon Carter: Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.\n [Steve realizes who exactly Sharon is, and takes a surprised breath.]\n Sharon Carter: She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.\n [She looks directly at Steve.]\n Sharon Carter: I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say \" No, you move.\"\n\n\n [Later, Steve stands alone in the isle, still dressed in black. Natasha to him and he turns to her. He begins to speak without any introduction]\n Steve Rogers: When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her.\n Natasha Romanoff: She had you back, too.\n Steve Rogers: Who else signed?\n Natasha Romanoff: Tony. Rhodey. Vision.\n Steve Rogers: Clint?\n Natasha Romanoff: Says he's retired.\n [She smiles slightly.]\n Steve Rogers: Wanda?\n Natasha Romanoff: TBD (To Be Determined). I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.\n [Steve sighs and bows his head.]\n Natasha Romanoff: Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.\n [Natasha almost seems to be convincing herself.]\n Steve Rogers: What are we giving up to do it?\n [She sighs. He shakes his head, unconvinced.]\n Steve Rogers: I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.\n Natasha Romanoff: I know.\n Steve Rogers: Then what are you doing here?\n Natasha Romanoff: I didn't want you to be alone.\n [She pulls him in for a hug.]\n Natasha Romanoff: Come here.\n\n\n [Vienna.]\n [The United Nations, a modern complex of interestingly-shaped high rise buildings.]\n News Anchor #3: At a special United Nations conference 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords.\n [T'Challa wears a sharp suit and stands, looking through a glass wall.]\n UN staffer: Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?\n Natasha Romanoff: Yes?\n UN staffer: These need your signature. [T'Challa looks over at Natasha.] Thank you.\n Natasha Romanoff: Thanks.\n T'Challa: I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.\n Natasha Romanoff: Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.\n T'Challa: You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.\n Natasha Romanoff: Well, I'm not.\n T'Challa: That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff.\n Natasha Romanoff: Why? You don't approve of all this?\n T'Challa: The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred.\n King T'Chaka: Unless you need to move a piano.\n T'Challa: Father.\n King T'Chaka: Son. Miss Romanoff.\n Natasha Romanoff: King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria.\n King T'Chaka: Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.\n Natasha Romanoff: Yes, so am I.\n Man on speakers: If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.\n T'Challa: That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.\n Natasha Romanoff: Thank you. [Natasha goes.]\n King T'Chaka: For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it.\n T'Challa: I'm happy, Father.\n King T'Chaka: Thank you.\n T'Challa: Thank you.\n King T'Chaka: When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. [T'Challa spots something outside.] Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.\n T'Challa: EVERYBODY GET DOWN!\n [An enormous explosion goes off between two buildings and destroys the conference hall. T'Challa finds his father lying on the floor with his eyes closed. He grabs his father's wrist and feels for a pulse, but his father lies still. Devastated T'Challa lies across his father. He lifts him up and rocks him in his arms.]\n\n\n [A hotel.]\n Sharon Carter: My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster.\n Steve Rogers: Very practical.\n Sharon Carter: And stylish. [Sharon and Steve wait by an elevator. They stand facing each other.]\n Steve Rogers: CIA has you stationed over here now?\n Sharon Carter: In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force.\n Steve Rogers: Right. Right. Sounds fun.\n Sharon Carter: I know, right?\n Steve Rogers: [Steve nods and smiles at Sharon.] I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .\n Sharon Carter: You mean when I was doing my job.\n Steve Rogers: Did Peggy know?\n Sharon Carter: She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you. [The elevator arrives.] Thanks for walking me back.\n Steve Rogers: Sure. [Sam comes over.]\n Sam Wilson: Steve. There's something you gotta see.\n News anchor #4: A bomb hidden in a news van . . .\n Sharon Carter: Who's coordinating?\n News anchor #4: . . . ripped through the UN building in Vienna.\n Sharon Carter: Good. They're solid. Forensics?\n News anchor #4: More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations.\n Sharon Carter: I have to go to work.\n\n\n [Fire crews hose down the buildings. A red and white medical chopper flies overhead.]\n Sharon Carter: Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it. [Sharon strides through with a man in a green jumpsuit. They pass T'Challa who sits on a bench looking stunned. There's a cut on his head. Natasha sits on the next bench along.]\n Natasha Romanoff: I'm very sorry.\n T'Challa: [He glances at her. He's holding an ornate silver ring which he toys with between his fingers.] In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever.\n Natasha Romanoff: That sounds very peaceful.\n T'Challa: My father thought so. [He puts the ring on his finger.] I am not my father.\n Natasha Romanoff: T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.\n T'Challa: [He clenches his fist.] Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself. [He walks away.]\n [Steve phones Natasha. He's standing on the street in a cap and dark glasses.]\n Natasha Romanoff: Yeah?\n Steve Rogers: You alright?\n Natasha Romanoff: Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. [Frowning she looks around, then stands up.] I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please.\n Steve Rogers: Are you saying you'll arrest me?\n Natasha Romanoff: No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.\n Steve Rogers: If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in.\n Natasha Romanoff: Why?\n Steve Rogers: Because I'm the one least likely to die trying. [Not far away Steve ends the call.]\n Natasha Romanoff: Shit.\n [Steve approaches Sam sitting at the counter of a coffee shop.]\n Sam Wilson: She tell you to stay out of it? [He's also in a cap and shades.] Might have a point.\n Steve Rogers: He'd do it for me.\n Sam Wilson: 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. [Sharon arrives by Steve.]\n Sharon Carter: Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this. [She slides Steve a file.] My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get.\n Steve Rogers: Thank you.\n Sharon Carter: And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.\n\n\n [Zemo sits in a hotel room. He reads from Karpov's red book.]\n Helmut Zemo: \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0443. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0443. \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d. \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d. \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u2026 \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d. \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432- ([subtitled] Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.) [Knocking at the door. He puts the book in a drawer and goes to the door. He reaches for a gun tucked in the back of his trouser and cocks it.]\n German Innkeeper: Herr M\u00fcller, ich habe Ihr Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck. ([subtitled] Mr. M\u00fcller. I have your breakfast.) [Zemo opens the door.]\n Helmut Zemo: Ich konnte es schon von weitem riechen. Danke. ([subtitled] I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.)\n German Innkeeper: Speck und schwarzer Kaffe. Wieder. Ich kann Ihnen auch was anderes machen, wenn Sie das m\u00f6chten. ([subtitled] Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like.)\n Helmut Zemo: Bitte sehr, das ist wunderbar. ([subtitled] It's okay. This is wonderful.)\n German Innkeeper: Ich stell es dann mal hier hin\u2026 ([subtitled] I'll put this on your . . .)\n Helmut Zemo: Nein, nein. Das geht schon. Ich mach das. Vielen Dank, Frau Leiber. ([subtitled] No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.) [Zemo closes the door. In the room is a large device with a cage at the bottom and a drum of coppered wire on top.]\n\n\n [Bucharest. Bucky is in civvies at a fruit store. He buys some plums!]\n Bucky Barnes: [talking to the vendor in Romanian] ([assumed translation] How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.[2])\n [In a black cap and casual jacket Bucky walks along scanning around. Across the street he spots a twenty-something vender at a news-stand watching him. Bucky glances away, then looks back at the vender who's still watching him. The vender runs from his kiosk. Bucky goes over and picks up a paper. On the front page there are surveillance-photos of a man and the head line: 'Winter Soldier cautat pentru Bombardmentul din Viena'. Bucky glances around tensely.]\n [In his dark blue, armored suit with his shield on his arm Steve is in a small apartment. He looks around, there's a mattress with disheveled covers and various bits of cheap looking furniture. The kitchen and bedroom are in the same room. Steve finds a notebook on top of the fridge. He picks it up and opens it. There are tabs of varying colors sticking out from amongst the pages.]\n Sam Wilson: [on radio] Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south.\n Steve Rogers: Understood. [Bucky's standing behind Steve. Steve slowly turns around to face him.] Do you know me?\n Bucky Barnes: [Bucky stares at him.] You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.\n Sam Wilson: They've set the perimeter.\n Steve Rogers: I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.\n Bucky Barnes: I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.\n Sam Wilson: They're entering the building.\n Steve Rogers: Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive.\n Bucky Barnes: That's smart. Good strategy.\n Sam Wilson: They're on the roof. I'm compromised.\n [Armed cops run upstairs.]\n Steve Rogers: This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.\n [Outside the door a cop readies a battering ram.]\n Bucky Barnes: It always ends in a fight.\n Sam Wilson: 5 seconds.\n Steve Rogers: You pulled me from the river. Why?\n Bucky Barnes: I don't know.\n Sam Wilson: 3 seconds!\n Steve Rogers: Yes, you do.\n Sam Wilson: Breach! Breach! Breach! [A grenade crashes through the window. Bucky kicks it to Steve, and he smothers it with his shield.]\n GSG-9 Soldier: Schie\u00df die T\u00fcr auf! (Shoot the door!) [The cop slams the battering ram against the door. Bucky shields himself with the mattress against an attack from the window. He blocks the door with a table as cops swing in on cables. Steve pulls the rug from under a policeman, sending him flying. Bucky slams another policeman into the wall.]\n Steve Rogers: Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone.\n Bucky Barnes: [Bucky slams Steve down and punches a hole in the floor.] I'm not gonna kill anyone.\n [Bucky grabs a backpack from under the floorboards and throws it out of the window. Bucky and Steve get behind Steve's shield to avoid gunfire. Bucky shoves Steve and he knocks a cop over. Bucky holds up his metal hand and repells bullets, then slams a cop into shelves. Bucky picks up a large cement brick and slams it into a cop. Steve fights a cop on the balcony. A cop shoots around the door outside. Bucky punches through the wall beside he door. He lays into the cops. A cop descends through a sky-light on a zip wire. Bucky grabs the cop's gun and slams him into the wall. Bucky bashes a couple of cops with the battering ram. More of the police team hurry up the stairwell. Bucky jumps on the zip-line-guy and swings down a level.]\n GSG-9 Soldier: Der Verd\u00e4chtige ist ausgebrochen. Er ist am \u00f6stlichen Treppenschacht. ([subtitled] Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!)\n [Steve grabs the radio and crushes it. Steve jumps down a level as Bucky keeps punching the cops. Bucky tosses one of them over the railing and Steve catches him, stopping the cop from falling. He looks at Bucky wearily.]\n Steve Rogers: Come on, man.\n [Steve throws the cop up onto the landing. Bucky breaks a banister and swings down on it. Steve hurls a cop over his shoulders. Bucky lays into jet more cops and takes them out. A cop aims at Bucky and Steve knocks the gun from his hands with his shield which sticks in the wall. Bucky leaps down the stairwell and catches onto a railing. Steve pulls his shiel out of the wall. Bucky climbs up then runs along a corridor and leaps off a balcony. He tumbles onto the lower roof of the neighboring building where he finds where his backpack. he picks it up and runs.]\n [A muscular man clad entirely in black, Black Panther, slams into Bucky from behind, knocking him down. He has a full face mask with pointed ears. He extends his fingers and sharp claws pop out. He attacks Bucky with sweeping kicks and slashes. Bucky fights back but is kicked into a wall. Black Panther swipes his claws and spins gracefully. Bucky narrowly avoids being slashed, he holds up a metal bar to protect himself.]\n [Steve looks down at them as Falcon swoops from the sky.]\n Steve Rogers: Sam, southwest rooftop.\n Sam Wilson: Who the hell's the other guy?\n Steve Rogers: About to find out.\n [Steve leaps from the balcony down onto the neighboring building as a chopper flies up. Black Panther lunges at Bucky with his claws, but Bucky grabs his wrists. A soldier fires a machine gun from the chopper. The ammo bounces off Black Panther's armored suit.]\n Steve Rogers: Sam.\n Sam Wilson: Got him. [Sam flies down and shoves the chopper off course. Then swoops towards street level.]\n [Bucky breaks free from his attacker, slings his bag on his back, runs and jumps down a level. Black Panther slides down the wall using his claws for traction. Back lands at street level and the chase continues. Steve follows and lands rolling along the ground. Gunfire from the chopper tears up the sidewalk. Bucky jumps down through an opening and lands in an underpass, he runs through the traffic. Black Panther and Captain America drop down and chase after Bucky. A Special Forces Vehicle pursues them.]\n GSG-9 Driver: Stand down! Stand down! [The vehicle closes in, blue lights flashing. Steve leaps onto the vehicle and splinters the windshield. The driver stops, Steve yanks him from the vehicle and kicks the windshield out, then drives off.]\n [Bucky runs over the top of a speeding car, outpacing it. Black Panther is a few cars behind, keeping pace with Bucky. he leaps on the back of the 4x4 that Steve's driving. Steve swerves from side to side, trying to throw him off.]\n Steve Rogers: Sam, I can't shake this guy.\n Sam Wilson: Right behind you.\n [Several police cars join the chase. Steve side-swipes another car and drives on.]\n [Up ahead Bucky reaches a fork in the road and faces oncoming traffic. He leaps over a barrier. Steve drives through the barrier.]\n [A motorbike speeds towards Bucky. Bucky grabs the handlebar and spins the bike around in mid air, throwing the rider off. Bcuky gets on the bike and rides away sending cars careering out of the way. Steve keeps on Bucky's tail with Black Panther holding onto the back of the 4x4. They all rocket through another underpass. Sam flies into the underpass. Black Panther leaps off the front of the 4x4 onto Bucky's motorbike. Bucky flings him over his head and the bike leans down on its side. Bucky kicks his assailant away, straightens up and rides on. Black Panther catches a ride on Falcon's leg. Sam tries to kick Black Panther away. Bucky throws a sticky bomb and blows up the roof at the end of the underpass, bringing down tons of rubble. Black Panther leaps off from Falcon and throws Bucky off the motorbike. Steve swerves the 4x4 through the rubble, leaps out and pulls Black Panther away from Bucky. Steve stands, facing sleek and muscular Black Panther. Armed police arrive and surround them, guns aimed. War Machine leaps down from above and raises both hands.]\n James Rhodes: Stand down, now. [Bucky stands beside Steve who puts his shield on his back.] Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal. [Police move in and force Bucky to his knees. Black Panther raises his hands. A cop moves Steve's arms behind his back. Black Panther retracts his claws and pulls off his mask revealing his face. It's T'Challa. Steve and Rhodes look curious.]\n GSG-9 Soldier: Wie lautet der Befehl? (What's the order?)\n James Rhodes: Your highness. [Bucky's hauled flat on the ground.]\n\n\n [Avengers HQ. Vision follows a recipe.]\n Vision: 'A pinch of paprika.' A pinch. [He adds a pinch. Wanda strolls in.]\n Wanda Maximoff: Is that paprikash?\n Vision: I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.\n Wanda Maximoff: [She chuckles, stirs the ingredients in the pan with a spoon. She lifts the spoon to her lips, blows and has a taste. She smiles.] Spirits lifted.\n Vision: In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . .\n Wanda Maximoff: May I?\n Vision: Please. Wanda?\n Wanda Maximoff: Hmm.\n Vision: No one dislikes you, Wanda. [She frowns curiously.]\n Wanda Maximoff: Thanks.\n Vision: Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you.\n Wanda Maximoff: Are you?\n Vision: My amygdala is synthetic, so . . . [Wanda laughs.]\n Wanda Maximoff: I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . . [her fingers glow.] I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees.\n Vision: [He touches the mind stone in his forehead.] Do you know, I don't know what this is? [It glows.] Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.\n Wanda Maximoff: Are you afraid of it?\n Vision: I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it.\n Wanda Maximoff: [Wanda looks at the food.] I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.\n Vision: Alternatively, we could order a pizza?\n Wanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave?\n Vision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.\n Wanda Maximoff: I can protect myself.\n Vision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.\n Wanda Maximoff: And what do you want?\n Vision: For people to see you . . . as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]\n\n\n [Berlin, day. Traffic rolls around the victory column. Police convoy drives beside the river Spree. Amidst the convoy is a gray armed truck. Inside Bucky wears restraints inside a prison pod. Three armed guards sit on the other side of the glass-walled pod. A police motorbike stops traffic and a van driver looks affronted. The convoy turns a corner onto a bridge across the river. In an SUV T'Challa sits in front of Steve who sits in front of Sam.]\n Sam Wilson: So, you like cats?\n Steve Rogers: Sam.\n Sam Wilson: What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?\n Steve Rogers: Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?\n T'Challa: [T'Challes eyes narrow as he glances sideways.] The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? [Steve is stony faced as the convoy heads underground.]\n\n\n [In a light gray walled bunker Bucky's pod is carried away by a forklift. Nearby Steve gets out of the SUV and glances across at Bucky who doesn't spot him. With Sam and T'Challa Steve approaches Sharon who's standing with a diminutive, gray-head man.]\n Steve Rogers: What's gonna happen to him?\n Everett Ross: Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.\n Sharon Carter: This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.\n Steve Rogers: What about our lawyer?\n Everett Ross: Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.\n Sam Wilson: I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. [As they go Steve looks back and catches Bucky's eye.]\n [On a covered sky walk.]\n Everett Ross: You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?\n T'Challa: I don't intend on going anywhere.\n Natasha Romanoff: For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.\n Steve Rogers: He's alive.\n Tony Stark: [on his phone] No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.\n Natasha Romanoff: Try not to break anything while we fix this.\n Tony Stark: [still on the phone.] Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.\n Steve Rogers: 'Consequences'?\n Tony Stark: Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.\n Steve Rogers: I'm not getting that shield back, am I?\n Natasha Romanoff: Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.\n Sam Wilson: That's cold.\n Tony Stark: Warmer than jail.\n [At a power station surrounded by trees the van with the driver who was affronted by the police convoy pulls up by the open gate. Scowling he puts the parking break on and picks up a clip board.]\n Delivery Truck Driver: Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)\n [In a secured chamber a guard connects a pipe to Bucky's prison pod. The lights inside dim for a moment.]\n [Tony finds Steve in a glass-walled office overlooking the control room.]\n Tony Stark: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. [Tony shows him two pens in a black presentation box.] FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.\n Steve Rogers: Some would say it brought our country closer to war.\n Tony Stark: See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?\n Steve Rogers: Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.\n Tony Stark: We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .\n Steve Rogers: Pregnant?\n Tony Stark: No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.\n Steve Rogers: I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.\n Tony Stark: A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. [Tony stands up and paces.] In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.\n Steve Rogers: You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.\n Tony Stark: Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.\n Steve Rogers: I don't mean to make things difficult.\n Tony Stark: I know, because you're a very polite person.\n Steve Rogers: If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.\n Tony Stark: No, you don't.\n Steve Rogers: [Steve smiles thinly.] No, I don't. Sometimes . . .\n Tony Stark: Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.\n Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns thoughtfully and picks up one of the fountain pens. He stands up and paces, then turns to Tony. In the control room beyond there are multiple screens on the walls.] I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.\n Tony Stark: Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .\n Steve Rogers: Wanda? What about Wanda?\n Tony Stark: She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.\n Steve Rogers: Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .\n Tony Stark: What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.\n Steve Rogers: Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.\n Tony Stark: She's not a US citizen.\n Steve Rogers: Oh, come on, Tony.\n Tony Stark: And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.\n Steve Rogers: She's a kid!\n Tony Stark: GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.\n Steve Rogers: [Steve nods faintly.] You keep telling yourself that. [He puts the pen down.] Hate to break up the set. [He leaves the office and rueful Tony watches Bucky on one of the control room's screens.]\n\n\n Helmut Zemo: [The evaluator sits at a desk facing Bucky's pod. Inside Bucky's still restrained.] Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?\n Sharon Carter: [In an office with Sam and Steve.] The receipt for your gear.\n Sam Wilson: 'Bird costume'? Come on.\n Sharon Carter: I didn't write it. [Sharon pushes a button witch stops the restriction on the audio from Bucky's evaluation.]\n Helmut Zemo: I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.\n Bucky Barnes: My name is Bucky.\n [At the power station. The van driver honks and looks impatient watching the custodian's hut's front door.]\n Delivery Truck Driver: Hallo? ([subtitled] Hello?) [The custodian comes outside and the driver comes out of his van.] Hey. Ich hab eine gro\u00dfe f\u00fcr dich. ([subtitled] Hey. I have a big one for you.) [He opens the van's back doors and removes a large wooden crate.] Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen. (Okay. Here. Just sign here.)\n Custodian: Hier? (Here?)\n Delivery Truck Driver: Ja. (Yeah.) [The custodian signs for the crate.]\n [At the UN-bunker Steve studies the blurry photograph of the man who bombed the congress in Vienna.]\n Steve Rogers: Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?\n Sharon Carter: Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?\n Steve Rogers: Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.\n Sharon Carter: You're saying someone framed him to find him.\n Sam Wilson: Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.\n Steve Rogers: We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.\n Sharon Carter: Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. [Sharon's gaze falls on the evaluator in the screen, her eyes narrow.]\n Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns and looks around.] Yeah.\n Helmut Zemo: [In the secure chamber.] Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?\n Bucky Barnes: I don't want to talk about it.\n Helmut Zemo: You fear that\u2026 if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry. [Zemo gets a message on his screen: 'message inbox:1' touches it 'status: package delivered'.] We only have to talk about one.\n [At the power station the custodian opens the crate. Finding Zemo's large device inside, he looks confused. The driver is at the back door of his van.]\n Custodian: Hey, was ist das? (Hey. What is this?)\n Delivery Truck Driver: Ich wei\u00df es nicht. (I don't know.)\n [The device erupts. A bubble of energy engulfs the power station and sparks fly. In the city traffic lights fail. In the bunker the lights go out.]\n Everett Ross: Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.\n Tony Stark: FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.\n Sharon Carter: [In the office.] Sub-level 5, east wing. [T'Challa spots Steve and Sam bolting.]\n [In Bucky's pod.]\n Bucky Barnes: What the hell is this?\n Helmut Zemo: Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home. [Zemo removes his glasses then walks towards Bucky reading from the red book by torchlight.] \u0416\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. ([subtitled] Longing.)\n Bucky Barnes: [Bucky shuts his eyes.] No. [Bucky's head snaps back.]\n Helmut Zemo: \u0420\u0436\u0430\u0432\u044b\u0439. ([subtitled] Rusted.)\n Bucky Barnes: Stop.\n Helmut Zemo: \u0421\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u044c. ([subtitled] Seventeen.)\n Bucky Barnes: [Bucky's metal arm trembles in its restraint.] Stop. [He sneers angrily.]\n Helmut Zemo: \u0420\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442. ([subtitled] Daybreak.)\n [Bucky screams, clenches his fist and rips free of his restraints.]\n Helmut Zemo: \u041f\u0435\u0447\u044c. ([subtitled] Furnace.) \u0414\u0435\u0432\u044f\u0442\u044c. ([subtitled] Nine.)\n [Bucky thumps the inside of the pod.]\n Helmut Zemo: \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439. ([subtitled] Benign.)\n [Bucky punches harder.]\n Helmut Zemo: \u0412\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0443. ([subtitled] Homecoming.) \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d. ([subtitled:] One.) \u0413\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d. ([subtitled] Freight car.)\n [Bucky batteres the front of the pod with his metal fist and the glass screen flies clear. Zemo slowly rounds the pod with the book and the torch in hand. he stands before Bucky who straightens, a dark frown on his face.]\n Helmut Zemo: \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442? ([subtitled] Soldier?)\n Bucky Barnes: \u042f \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c. ([subtitled] Ready to comply.)\n Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16, 1991.\n\n\n [Steve and Sam arrive outside the chamber. Red emergency lights flash all around. There are many agents slumped on the floor. All of them out cold.]\n Helmut Zemo: Help me. Help.\n Steve Rogers: [Steve finds Zemo in a heap inside the chamber.] Get up. [he grabs Zemo and shoves him against the wall.] Who are you? What do you want?\n Helmut Zemo: To see an empire fall.\n [As Sam enters Bucky swings his fist which smashes through the wall as Sam ducks. Bucky grabs him by the jaw and throws him at the open pod. Steve lurches into the fight and lands a punch which Bucky barely feels. Bucky kicks and punches Steve out of the chamber. A punch from Bucky goes through the elevator door. Steve blocks the next one but the power of Bucky's fist sends Steve tumbling into the darkened elevator shaft.]\n [In the chamber Sam comes around and spots Zemo looking down the elevator shaft.]\n Man on PA #1: Der Ostfl\u00fcgel ist kompromittiert. Ich wiederhole: Der Ostfl\u00fcgel ist kompromittiert. (The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.)\n Sam Wilson: Hey.\n [Zemo bolts, Sam rises. At the bottom of the shaft Steve pushes himself off the floor.]\n\n\n [In the control room.]\n Everett Ross: Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air.\n Natasha Romanoff: Please tell me you brought a suit.\n Tony Stark: Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.\n Sharon Carter: Follow me. [Sharon runs past Tony and Natasha.]\n [Sam chases Zemo up a stair well.]\n [Steve starts to climb the elevator shaft.]\n [Bucky stalks through the building's ground floor. He batters two guards. With tech-glasses on Tony takes cover behind a pillar.]\n Natasha Romanoff: [on radio:] We're in position.\n [Tony taps a wrist-control which becomes his Iron Man-glove. He zaps Bucky with a stun-burst before Bucky can shoot a guard. Tony rushes him, firing again. Bucky ducks the blast then trades blows with Tony, firing the gun. Tony has the Iron Man-glove over the barrel, blocking the bullet. He pulls the gun barrel loose then Bucky smacks him backwards. Sharon rushes Bucky, then Natasha rushes Bucky. They both land kicks and punches, then Bucky flips Sharon head over heels. She smashes onto a table then Natasha leaps on Bucky, legs around his neck. He slams her onto another table and grabs her throat.]\n Natasha Romanoff: You could at least recognize me.\n [T'Challa comes from nowhere and kicks Bucky off Natasha. He fights with Bucky, landing lightning fast kicks and some punches. Bucky gets a counter punch in and T'Challa falls, but quickly recovers. Bucky hurries up some stairs. T'Challa leaps the levels and vaults a railing, landing in front of Bucky. Limber T'Challa spin-kicks and grabs Bucky's metal arm which he tries to twist then looks worried as he realizes it isn't going to work. He throws Bucky backwards and keeps hold as they both tumble down the stairs. They resume fighting on the small landing and a leg sweep sends Bucky over the railing. T'Challa leaps down after him but finds the wide reception empty. He scans around.]\n\n\n [Outside staff flee the building en masse. Sam is among them and quickly spots something on the ground. He picks it up.]\n Sam Wilson: Damn it. [he looks around the wide courtyard and scowls.]\n [Bucky's on the rooftop helipad. He marches up to a blue chopper and pulls the lock off the door. he gets in the pilot seat. Steve rushes outside and sprints toward the rising chopper. He leaps and grabs the landing gear. Muscles bulging Steve pulls hard and the chopper struggles to gain height. Steve's feet kick for traction then he gets them flat on the helipad. The chopper drags him onto the weak looking mesh framing the helipad. Steve grabs the railing with one hand and clings to the landing gear with the other. He grits his teeth and his neck strains with the incredible effort. Bucky glowers from inside the chopper then throws the joystick left and the chopper's nose slams into the edge of the helipad. The rotor-blades are smashed to pieces and Steve ducks as the tail swings around. The chopper lies twisted on the mesh at the edge of the pad. Steve rises beside the canopy. Bucky's arm smashes through the glass and growling he grabs Steve's throat. The chopper starts to list over the edge. The tail breaks off and falls into the river below. Bucky keeps hold of Steve as the whole vehicle drops and slams into the river. The impact seems to knock Bucky out cold and he lets go of Steve. The body of the chopper sinks quickly to the riverbed along with other debris. Steve surfaces with Bucky in his arms.]\n\n\n [At an airport Zemo listens to a phone message.:]\n Zemo's Wife: He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.\n [Frowning Zemo ends the call. A TV news report is playing nearby:]\n News anchor #5: James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird, ist heute aus der Haft entflohen. Ebenfalls vermisst werden die Avengers Captain Steve Rogers und Sam Wilson. ([subtitled:] James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)\n [Zemo eyes the TV screen. He stands in line at a departures gate. The screen above the gate reads: 'Gate 06 | Berlin Flughafen | AEM2103 | 14:10 | Moskau/Moscow']\n\n\n [In a huge abandoned warehouse Bucky comes to with his metallic left arm clamped in a huge industrial vice. Steve peers through a gap at a chopper flying overhead. Sam's over by Bucky.]\n Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve goes over to join Sam by Bucky who sits with his arm in the vice. They stare at him.]\n Bucky Barnes: Steve.\n Steve Rogers: Which Bucky am I talking to?\n Bucky Barnes: Your mom's name was Sarah. You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.\n Steve Rogers: Can't read that in a museum.\n Sam Wilson: Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?\n Bucky Barnes: What did I do?\n Steve Rogers: Enough.\n Bucky Barnes: Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words.\n Steve Rogers: Who was he?\n Bucky Barnes: I don't know.\n Steve Rogers: People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than \"I don't know.\"\n Bucky Barnes: He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.\n Steve Rogers: Why would he need to know that?\n Bucky Barnes: Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.\n\n\n [1991, at night Bucky rides alongside the car and somehow causes the car to crash. He circles back, pulls up and climbs off the motorbike. he's filmed on CCTV as he approaches the car's trunk. He janks it open, breaking the lock. Inside he opens a metal case which contains five clear drip bags filled with bright blue fluid.]\n [Four young men and a young woman sit up in hospital beds. The blue fluid is fed intravenously into their arms. The drip bags hang on stands beside them. They're all fit and muscular. One man, Josef, flexes a huge biceps. Josef is screaming, dragged into a cell and left on a bed.]\n Josef / Super Soldier #1: It hurts! [He struggles in leather bindings. A viewing slot is closed.]\n [Karpov is sitting at a desk in a corridor, making notes and listening. Karpov opens the door to a lab and switches on the light. Josef is sitting on a bed. He looks up at Karpov.]\n [Bucky and Josef fight each other in a barred chamber. The four others who were given the blue liquid are there. Josef kicks with enormous power, sending Bucky flying. Watching Karpov folds his arms.\n Vasily Karpov: \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e, \u0418\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0444. ([subtitled] Good work.)\n [A medic takes Josef's pulse and Josef slams him onto the floor. A soldier clubs Josef onto the back with no effect. Karpov gets behind Bucky and aims a gun.]\n Vasily Karpov: \u0421\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442, \u0432\u044b\u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0441\u044e\u0434\u0430! ([subtitled] Get me out of here.)\n [Josef and the other four Winter Soldiers effortlessly dispatch a squad of Soldiers. Bucky escorts covering Karpov from the barred chamber, batting guards aside.]\n\n\n Steve Rogers: Who were they?\n Bucky Barnes: Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.\n Sam Wilson: They all turn out like you?\n Bucky Barnes: Worse.\n Steve Rogers: The doctor, could he control them?\n Bucky Barnes: Enough.\n Steve Rogers: Said he wanted to see an empire fall.\n Bucky Barnes: With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.\n Sam Wilson: [Sam steps up to Steve.] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.\n Steve Rogers: If we call Tony . . .\n Sam Wilson: No, he won't believe us.\n Steve Rogers: Even if he did . . .\n Sam Wilson: Who knows if the Accords would let him help.\n Steve Rogers: We're on our own.\n Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.\n\n\n Secretary Ross: I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?\n Tony Stark: We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.\n Secretary Ross: You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this.\n Natasha Romanoff: What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?\n Secretary Ross: If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.\n Tony Stark: All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.\n Secretary Ross: How would that end any differently from the last time?\n Tony Stark: Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.\n Secretary Ross: 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.\n Tony Stark: Thank you, sir. [Tony rubs his hand on his chest and slumps, exhaling.] My left arm is numb, is that normal?\n Natasha Romanoff: [She pats him on the shoulder.] You alright?\n Tony Stark: Always. [He has a massive black eye and a cut on his brow.] 36 hours, jeez.\n Natasha Romanoff: We're seriously understaffed.\n Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?\n Natasha Romanoff: No. You really think he'd be on our side?\n Tony Stark: No.\n Natasha Romanoff: I have an idea.\n Tony Stark: Me too. Where's yours?\n Natasha Romanoff: Downstairs. Where's yours? [Tony smiles slightly.]\n\n\n [Queens, New York. Peter Parker walks out of an elevator holding a DVD-player and with a backpack on his shoulder. He walks into an apartment where his Aunt May is sitting on the couch with Tony Stark.]\n Peter Parker: Hey, May.\n May Parker: Mmm. Hey. How was school today?\n Peter Parker: Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . [Peter sees Tony and his eyes widen.]\n Tony Stark: Oh, Mr. Parker.\n Peter Parker: Um . . . [He takes out his earphones.] What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.\n Tony Stark: Tony.\n Peter Parker: What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?\n Tony Stark: It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?\n Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah.\n Tony Stark: Right?\n Peter Parker: Regarding the . . .\n May Parker: You didn't tell me about the grant.\n Peter Parker: About the grant.\n Tony Stark: The September Foundation.\n Peter Parker: Right.\n Tony Stark: Yeah. Remember when you applied?\n Peter Parker: Yeah.\n Tony Stark: I approved, so now we're in business.\n May Parker: You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?\n Peter Parker: Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?\n Tony Stark: That's what I'm here to hash out.\n Peter Parker: Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.\n Tony Stark: It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.\n May Parker: Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?\n Tony Stark: This walnut date loaf is exceptional.\n Peter Parker: Let me just stop you there.\n Tony Stark: Yeah?\n Peter Parker: Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?\n Tony Stark: Yeah.\n Peter Parker: Yeah?\n Tony Stark: It's pretty well funded.\n Peter Parker: Wow.\n Tony Stark: Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?\n May Parker: Sure.\n Tony Stark: [In Peter's bedroom Tony bolts the door and spits out the walnut loaf.] As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. [He notices Peter's collection of old computers.] Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?\n Peter Parker: Uh, the garbage, actually.\n Tony Stark: You're a dumpster diver.\n Peter Parker: Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.\n Tony Stark: Ah-ah! Me first.\n Peter Parker: Okay.\n Tony Stark: Quick question of the rhetorical variety. [He pulls out his phone which projects a video of Peter Parker in his Spider-Man outfit.] That's you, right?\n Peter Parker: Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?\n Tony Stark: Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.\n Peter Parker: That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.\n Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.\n Peter Parker: It's like that video. What is it?\n Tony Stark: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?\n Peter Parker: Exactly.\n Tony Stark: Oh, what have we here?\n Peter Parker: [Peter hides his Spider-Man suit.] Uh . . . that's a . . .\n Tony Stark: So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?\n Peter Parker: [Peter folds his arms petulantly.] S . . . Spider-Man.\n Tony Stark: Not in that onesie, you're not.\n Peter Parker: It's not a onesie. [Tony picks up the suit.] I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!\n Tony Stark: Who else knows? Anybody?\n Peter Parker: Nobody.\n Tony Stark: Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?\n Peter Parker: No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.\n Tony Stark: You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?\n Peter Parker: I did.\n Tony Stark: Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Cohesive gloves.\n Peter Parker: It's a long story. I was uh . . .\n Tony Stark: Lordy! Can you even see in these?\n Peter Parker: Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that\u2026 when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.\n Tony Stark: You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. [Peter sits on his bed and looks at Tony.] Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?\n Peter Parker: Because . . . [he fiddles with his fingers] because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.\n Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.\n Peter Parker: I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.\n Tony Stark: Sure, because you're different.\n Peter Parker: Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . . [Tony leans closer.] and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.\n Tony Stark: [he looks affected by Peter's words.] So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?\n Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.\n Tony Stark: [He slowly steps over to Peter whose leg is stretched out on the bed. Tony looks down at it.] I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. [Peter moves along. Tony sits beside him and raises his hand. He hesitantly clasps Peter's shoulder.] You got a passport?\n Peter Parker: Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.\n Tony Stark: You ever been to Germany?\n Peter Parker: No.\n Tony Stark: Oh, you'll love it.\n Peter Parker: I can't go to Germany!\n Tony Stark: Why?\n Peter Parker: I got . . . homework.\n Tony Stark: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.\n Peter Parker: I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!\n Tony Stark: Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.\n Peter Parker: [He webs Tony's hand to the door.] Don't tell Aunt May.\n Tony Stark: Alright, Spider-Man. [They share an earnest look before Tony returns to his usual attitude.] Get me out of this.\n Peter Parker: Sorry, I'll get the . . .\n\n\n [Night, at Avengers' HQ. Vision floats above the floor. An explosion in the distance lights up the room for a moment. Vision and Wanda look out of the window.]\n Wanda Maximoff: What is it?\n Vision: Stay here, please.\n [Vision goes. Suddenly Wanda compels a knife across the room. It stops dead in front of Clint's head.]\n Clint Barton: Guess I shoulda knocked.\n Wanda Maximoff: Oh my god! What are you doing here?\n Clint Barton: Disappointing my kids. [He shoots arrows to both sides of the room.] I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.\n Vision: Clint! [Wanda and Clint stop.] You should not be here.\n Clint Barton: [He turns around.] Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit.\n Vision: Please consider the consequences of your actions.\n Clint Barton: Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go. [Vision is held in a force field, crackling and sparkling between the two arrows.] It's this way.\n Wanda Maximoff: I've caused enough problems.\n Clint Barton: [Frowning Clint runs back from the door.] You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit. [Vision breaks the force field with his mind stone. He punches Clint to the floor, Clint recovers quickly.] I knew I should've stretched. [He extends a baton and tries to hit Vision, but the blows go through him. Clint resorts to punches, then tries the baton again. It breaks. Clint tries to kick Vision, but his leg goes right through him. Vision gets Clint in a headlock.]\n Vision: Clint, you can't overpower me.\n Clint Barton: I know I can't. But she can.\n Wanda Maximoff: Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving.\n Vision: I can't let you.\n Wanda Maximoff: [She holds her hands apart, glowing with energy. Clint slips from Vision's grasp.] I'm sorry.\n Vision: [He falters.] If you do this .  . . they will never stop being afraid of you.\n Wanda Maximoff: I can't control their fear, only my own. [She moves closer. Vision glows from within and crashes through the floor, and several floors beneath. Wanda and Clint stand over the holes in the floors.]\n Clint Barton: Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.\n\n\n [Back at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre:]\n Attache: It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans.\n Security Chief: [to Natasha who's standing in their way] Move, or you will be moved.\n T'Challa: As entertaining as that would be . . .\n Natasha Romanoff: You really think you can find him?\n T'Challa: My resources are considerable.\n Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time.\n T'Challa: You know where they are.\n Natasha Romanoff: I know someone who does.\n\n\n [Under an overpass:]\n Sharon Carter: Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.\n Steve Rogers: It's low profile.\n Sharon Carter: Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. [She opens the trunk of her car, revealing Steve's and Sams's gear.]\n Bucky Barnes: [He sits behind Sam in the getaway car.] Can you move your seat up?\n Sam Wilson: No.\n Steve Rogers: I owe you again.\n Sharon Carter: Keeping a list. [She glances at Bucky.] You know, he kinda tried to kill me.\n Steve Rogers: Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you.\n Sharon Carter: I know.\n Steve Rogers: Thank you, Sharon.\n Sharon Carter: That was . . .\n Steve Rogers: Late.\n Sharon Carter: Damn right. I should go.\n Steve Rogers: Okay.\n\n\n [On the 6th level of a parking garage at the Leipzig/Halle airport. Steve drives into the parking lot in the battered, old car. He parks by a grey van and gets out.]\n Clint Barton: Cap.\n Steve Rogers: You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.\n Clint Barton: Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt.\n Steve Rogers: Thanks for having my back.\n Wanda Maximoff: It was time to get off my ass.\n Steve Rogers: How about our other recruit?\n Clint Barton: He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but\u2026 he should be good.\n Scott Lang: What timezone is this?\n Clint Barton: Come on. Come on.\n Scott Lang: [Scott shakes Steve's hand with an amazed look.] Captain America.\n Steve Rogers: Mr. Lang.\n Scott Lang: It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. [He looks at Wanda.] I know you, too. You're great! [He turns back and feels Steve's shoulders.] Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me. [(sic!) To Sam.] Hey, man!\n Sam Wilson: What's up, Tic Tac?\n Scott Lang: Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . .\n Sam Wilson: It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again.\n Steve Rogers: They tell you what we're up against?\n Scott Lang: Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?\n Steve Rogers: We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.\n Scott Lang: Yeah, well, what else is new?\n Bucky Barnes: We should get moving.\n Clint Barton: We got a chopper lined up.\n Man on PA #2: Dies ist eine Notsituation. Alle Passagiere m\u00fcssen den Flughafen sofort evakuieren. (This is an emergency. All passengers must evacuate the airport immediately.)\n Bucky Barnes: They're evacuating the airport.\n Sam Wilson: Stark.\n Scott Lang: Stark?\n Steve Rogers: Suit up.\n\n\n [Steve in his uniform strides through an underpass, then jogs onto a private runway, heading for a grounded chopper. An electro-disabler slams onto the chopper and Steve looks up. Iron Man and War Machine decent.]\n Tony Stark: Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?\n James Rhodes: Definitely weird.\n Steve Rogers: Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.\n T'Challa: [T'Challa leaps over a truck.] Captain.\n Steve Rogers: Your highness.\n Tony Stark: Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?\n Steve Rogers: You're after the wrong guy.\n Tony Stark: Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.\n Steve Rogers: And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.\n Natasha Romanoff: Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?\n Tony Stark: All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! [Peter shoots a web, stealing Steve's shield and binding his hands.] Nice job, kid.\n Peter Parker: Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit\u2026 Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you.\n Tony Stark: Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.\n Peter Parker: Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.\n Tony Stark: Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .\n Peter Parker: Hey, everyone.\n Tony Stark: . . . Good job.\n Steve Rogers: You've been busy.\n Tony Stark: And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.\n Steve Rogers: You did that when you signed.\n Tony Stark: Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. [Steve looks aside.] Come on.\n Sam Wilson: [He radios Steve.] We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.\n Steve Rogers: [Steve holds his hands up and Clint shoots the web off.] Alright, Lang.\n Peter Parker: Hey, guys, something . . . \n James Rhodes: Whoa. What--what the hell was that?\n Scott Lang: [He retrieves Steve's shield.] I believe this is yours, Captain America.\n Tony Stark: Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?\n James Rhodes: Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.\n T'Challa: Barnes is mine!\n Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?\n Tony Stark: What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.\n Peter Parker: Okay, copy that!\n T'Challa: Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time.\n Scott Lang: [He faces Natasha.] Look, I really don't want to hurt you.\n Natasha Romanoff: I wouldn't stress about it. [She kicks him in the groin and he miniaturizes, throwing her head over heels. She zaps him off her wrist and he slams into a nearby truck, laving a small dent.]\n Bucky Barnes: [In the terminal.] What the hell is that?\n Sam Wilson: Everyone's got a gimmick now.\n Peter Parker: [Peter swings through the glass wall and kicks Sam backwards. Bucky throws a punch, Peter catches his fist.] You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude! [Sam hits Peter.] You have the right to remain silent! [Mid-air Peter fends Sam off, then swings after him using his webs.]\n [Iron Man shoots rockets that explode just beyond Clint and Wanda.]\n [Steve fights hand to hand with T'Challa. War Machine locks on.]\n James Rhodes: Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. [He smacks Steve's shield with a mace.]\n Tony Stark: [Hovering above the ground.] Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.\n Wanda Maximoff: You locked me in my room.\n Tony Stark: Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.\n Clint Barton: Hey, man.\n Tony Stark: Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?\n Clint Barton: Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. [He fires an arrow which Tony deflects.]\n Tony Stark: First time for everything.\n Clint Barton: Made you look.\n [Suddenly a car slams past Iron Man. He looks up as dozens more come crashing down. Wanda rows her glowing hands until Iron Man is buried under a pile of cars.]\n FRIDAY: Multiple contusions detected.\n Tony Stark: Yeah, I detected that too.\n [Peter wings through the rafters in the terminal, chasing Sam who flies backwards firing shots. Peter stops on a high beam.]\n Peter Parker: Oh god. [Bucky throws something at him.] Hey buddy, I think you lost this! [Peter throws it back. Sam kicks him off the beam and Peter fires a web which sends Sam crashing to the floor. Peter webs Sam's wrist to a balcony railing.] Those wings carbon fiber?\n Sam Wilson: Is this stuff coming out of you?\n Peter Parker: That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.\n Sam Wilson: I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.\n Peter Parker: Alright, sorry, my bad. [He swings down and Bucky jumps in the way. Bucky and Sam fall through the glass down onto the next floor and Peter webs them.] Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, l'm really sorry. [Redwing drags Peter through the glass wall.] Wwahhhh!\n Bucky Barnes: You couldn't have done that earlier?\n Sam Wilson: I hate you.\n [Outside Steve kicks War Machine out of the air, then sends T'Challa reeling. War Machine's mace is broken.]\n James Rhodes: Great.\n Scott Lang: Hey, Cap, heads up! [He throws Steve a miniature truck.] Throw it at this. Now! [Steve throws it and the truck enlarges, tumbling towards War Machine.]\n James Rhodes: Oh, come on! [The truck lands and explodes.]\n Scott Lang: Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry. [Scott and Steve run off.]\n James Rhodes: Alright. Now, I'm pissed.\n Natasha Romanoff: [Tony helps her up.] Is this, part of the plan?\n Tony Stark: Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?\n Clint Barton: [To Wanda as he spots the Quinjet.] There's our ride.\n Steve Rogers: Come on!\n\n\n[Steve's team runs towards the Quinjet. A fizzing stream of energy slices across the runway and they stop. Vision hovers overhead.]\n Vision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]\n Sam Wilson: What do we do, Cap?\n Steve Rogers: We fight.\n Natasha Romanoff: This is gonna end well. [The two teams stride towards each other with grim determination etched on their faces.]\n Peter Parker: They're not stopping.\n Tony Stark: Neither are we. [Everyone breaks into a sprint.]\n [Steve blocks a punch as Iron Man lands. Clint fires an arrow at Vision. War Machine flies after Falcon and Bucky trades blows with T'Challa. An explosive arrow hits Iron Man. Natasha throws Scott, as Peter swings through the air, struggling to evade vehicles projected by Wanda. Bucky lands punches on T'Challa, Clint and Natasha battle with batons. Clint pins her down with his bow.]\n Natasha Romanoff: We're still friends, right?\n Clint Barton: Depends on how hard you hit me. [She spins him with her legs. As she's about to kick his head, her foot stops and glows bright red. Wanda projects Natasha down.]\n Wanda Maximoff: You were pulling your punches. [Clint nods sheepishly.]\n Bucky Barnes: [Bucky and T'Challa have each other by the throat.] I didn't kill your father.\n T'Challa: Then why did you run? [T'Challa pulls Bucky's hand off his neck, then spins him and fly-kicks him backwards. He sprouts claws and aims for Bucky's neck, but Wanda stops his hand, then waves her arms and sends T'Challa crashing into a passenger gangway.]\n [Peter swings past, Steve snaps the web with his shield.]\n Peter Parker: That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.\n Steve Rogers: Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.\n Peter Parker: Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow. [he fires webs which stick to Steve's shield and ankle. He pulls and Steve slides towards him. Peter kicks him backwards, then rolls clear.] He also said to go for your legs. [As Steve runs to get his shield, Peter webs his hands and pulls. Steve grits his teeth, spins and somersaults, propelling Peter through the air.]\n Sam Wilson: [Evading fire from Iron Man.] Clint, can you get him off me?\n Clint Barton: Buckled in?\n Scott Lang: Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go! [Miniaturized Scott is on the tip of Clint's arrow. As he fires it, the head splits and Iron Man shoots the shards. Scott dives between Iron Man's splayed fingers and slips inside the Iron Man Suit at the shoulder joint.]\n Steve Rogers: [Steve catches a web and tugs Peter towards him, knocking him down with the shield. Peter recovers and pulls himself up on top of a gangway.] Stark tell you anything else?\n Peter Parker: That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. [He swings down and Steve leaps to kick him backwards onto the gangway's leg.]\n Steve Rogers: Guess he had a point. [He throws his shield at the leg and the gangway falls. Peter holds it up.] You got heart, kid. Where're you from?\n Peter Parker: Queens.\n Steve Rogers: Brooklyn. [Steve leaves Peter holding the gangway.]\n Tony Stark: [Clint fires arrows at hovering Iron Man whose arm-lasers malfunction.] Friday?\n FRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline.\n Tony Stark: They what?\n Scott Lang: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.\n Tony Stark: Who's speaking?\n Scott Lang: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.\n Tony Stark: Friday?\n FRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system.\n Scott Lang: Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa! [Inside the suit Scott sprints through narrow banks of components, chased by a rolling cloud of CO2. He's ejected from the suit.]\n Bucky Barnes: [To Steve.] We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.\n Steve Rogers: We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.\n Sam Wilson: No, you get to the jet! Both of you! [Being chased by War Machine.] The rest of us aren't getting out of here.\n Clint Barton: As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.\n Sam Wilson: This isn't the real fight, Steve.\n Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, what's the play?\n Sam Wilson: We need a diversion, something big.\n Scott Lang: I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.\n Bucky Barnes: He's gonna tear himself in half?\n Steve Rogers: You're sure about this, Scott?\n Scott Lang: I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS! [He leaps from mobile stairs and lands on War Machine's back as he flies past. He operates his suit's wrist, shuts his eyes and activates a remote. Scott grows into a towering Behemoth and grabs War Machine's leg.]\n Peter Parker: Holy shit!\n James Rhodes: Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.\n Steve Rogers: I guess that's the signal.\n Sam Wilson: Way to go, Tic Tac!\n Tony Stark: Give me back my Rhodey. [Sam flies feet first into Iron Man.]\n Peter Parker: I got him! [Scott sends War Machine flying and Peter catches him with a web.]\n [Scott kicks a bus towards T'Challa. Vision descends and braces himself, splitting the bus in two and protecting T'Challa from harm. T'Challa spots Steve and Bucky sprinting past. Chasing Sam Iron Man evades Scott swinging the wing of a plane at him.]\n Tony Stark: Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.\n [Sam arrows towards Iron Man, firing Red Wing which cracks into Tony's helmet. Scott blocks T'Challa's path.]\n Scott Lang: You wanna get to them\u2026 you gotta go through me. [He sweeps his gigantic foot through the crates T'Challa's standing on, smashing them to pieces. Scott is engulfed in explosions as War Machine swoops towards him with Peter clinging to a web stuck to War Machine's back. He fires more webs and wraps them around Scott's over-sized arms.]\n [Clint fires arrows at T'Challa who catches two right in front of his face. After the arrowheads explode he drops them and rises extending his claws.]\n Clint Barton: We haven't met yet. [He flattens his bow and spins it around.] I'm Clint.\n T'Challa: I don't care. [Wielding the bow like a staff Clint attacks T'Challa who a acrobatically ducks then counters with a high kick.]\n [Giant Ant-Man punches War Machine in the air and swings a gangway towards him as he recovers. War Machine opens fire and the gangway disintegrates. Scott tries to stamp on War Machine who dives clear evading a lunge of Scott's hand. War Machine is struck by something.]\n James Rhodes: Ahhh! [Wanda waves her hands flinging vehicles into War Machines path.]\n Scott Lang: Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me! [Vision fires a shining beam of energy from his mind stone and the control tower collapses towards the entrance of the hangar. Wanda struggles to slow its collapse. Then War Machine descends behind her fires a sonic disruptor. Wanda holds her head and screams. The tower falls all around Steve and Bucky, but they make it into the hangar where Natasha is waiting for them.]\n Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna stop.\n Steve Rogers: You know I can't.\n Natasha Romanoff: I'm gonna regret this. [She stuns T'Challa who's arrived behind them.] Go. [Steve and Bucky run for the Quinjet as she keeps T'Challa at bay.]\n Peter Parker: [Outside] Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?\n James Rhodes: Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?\n Tony Stark: I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.\n Peter Parker: [He swings towards Ant-Man.] You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? [He wraps webs around Scott's legs.]\n Tony Stark: Maybe the kid's on to something.\n James Rhodes: High now, Tony. Go high.\n Peter Parker: [He swings around and around Ant-Man's legs as Iron Man and War Machine power towards his head, both landing blows together.] YES! Ha ha! That was awesome! [Giant Ant-Man topples. A flailing limb catching Peter and knocking him flying just before Scott slams into the ground on his back. He returns to normal size and removes the face-plate of his helmet, grimacing.]\n Scott Lang: Does anyone have any orange slices?\n Tony Stark: [He lands by Peter who's in a heap. Retracting the helmet Tony looks concerned.] Kid, you alright?\n Peter Parker: Hey! Get off me!\n Tony Stark: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.\n Peter Parker: Oh. Hey, man.\n Tony Stark: Yeah.\n Peter Parker: That was scary.\n Tony Stark: Yeah. You're done. Alright?\n Peter Parker: What?\n Tony Stark: You did a good job. Stay down.\n Peter Parker: No, I'm good. I'm fine.\n Tony Stark: Stay down.\n Peter Parker: No, it's good I gotta get him back!\n Tony Stark: You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!\n Peter Parker: Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . . [He slumps down.] Okay, I'm done. I'm done.\n Natasha Romanoff: [In the partially wrecked hangar the Quinjet's engines fire and the guns blast debris from the entrance. Natasha keeps T'Challa held until the jet rises. Black Panther leaps, but can't keep hold and the Quinjet flies out of the hangar. War Machine flies after it. In the hangar:] I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference.\n\n\n Vision: [Outside Vision kneels beside Wanda and gently holds her in his arms. She pants for breath.] I'm sorry.\n Wanda Maximoff: Me, too.\n Vision: It's as I said. Catastrophe.\n [Piloting the Quinjet, Steve looks over his shoulder and spots War Machine encroaching to the right. Steve pushes forward on the thrusters. Iron Man flies beside War Machine and Falcon follows them.]\n James Rhodes: Vision, I got a bandit on my six. [Falcon fires small explosives which erupt and buffet War Machine.] Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.\n [Vision takes aim and fires his head laser. Falcon spots it coming and tucks into a tumble. The laser overshoots and slices through the core on War Machines chest plate. War Machine loses power and goes into a spinning free fall.]\n Tony Stark: Rhodey! [Iron Man and Falcon dive.]\n James Rhodes: Tony, I'm flying dead stick. [As he plunges the suit emits black smoke. Iron Man swoops down towards him. Rhodes' eyes start to close.]\n Tony Stark: RHODES! [Mar Machine smacks into a wide, grassy field just before Iron Man lands nearby. His helmet retracts and he pulls off War Machine's face plate. Rhodes' eyes are closed and there's blood on his face.] Read vitals.\n FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.\n Sam Wilson: [He swoops down and lands on his feet. His wings retract.] I'm sorry. [Tony zaps Falcon backwards with a blast of energy from the palm of his suit. Vision glides to the ground just in front of Falcon. Stony faced Tony remains with his arms around War Machine.]\n\n\n [Somewhere in Siberia, Zemo makes a phone call.]\n German Innkeeper: Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice? (Good morning. Room service.)\n Helmut Zemo: Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier (Good morning, Mrs. Leiber. [subtitled] This is room 201.)\n German Innkeeper: Ah, Herr M\u00fcller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee f\u00fcr Sie, ja? (Ah, Mr. M\u00fcller. [subtitled] Bacon and black coffee again today?)\n Helmut Zemo: Wie gut Sie mich kennen. ([subtitled] You know me so well.)\n [In his room in Berlin, Germany.]\n German Innkeeper: Hallo? Ihr Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr M\u00fcller? Herr M\u00fcller? Oh mein Gott! ([subtitled] Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr M\u00fcller? Mr M\u00fcller? Oh God!) [She comes in and discovers the dead body of Dr. Theo Broussard in the bathtub.]\n\n\n [Steve flies the Quinjet towards mountains, Bucky sits behind him.]\n Bucky Barnes: What's gonna happen to your friends?\n Steve Rogers: [Steve stares ahead, heavyhearted. He sighs and shakes his head.] Whatever it is\u2026 I'll deal with it.\n Bucky Barnes: [He looks thoughtful.] I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.\n Steve Rogers: [He glances around at Bucky.] What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.\n Bucky Barnes: I know. But I did it.\n\n\n [At a hospital Rhodes lies inside an CT-scanner. He's in a blue gown covering his body. Tony paces up to Vision who watches Rhodes grave faced.]\n Tony Stark: How did this happen?\n Vision: I became distracted.\n Tony Stark: I didn't think that was possible.\n Vision: Neither did I. [Tony leaves Vision looking in on Rhodes. Along the corridor Tony spots an equally concerned Natasha.]\n [Tony and Natasha stand on a balcony looking towards a row of trees.]\n Tony Stark: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.\n Natasha Romanoff: Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.\n Tony Stark: You let them go, Nat.\n Natasha Romanoff: We played this wrong.\n Tony Stark: 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.\n Natasha Romanoff: Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?\n Tony Stark: T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.\n Natasha Romanoff: I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. [She walks away.]\n Tony Stark: [He activates holographic images appearing on his wrist device.] What am I looking at, Friday?\n FRIDAY: Priority upload from Berlin police.\n Tony Stark: Fire up the chopper.\n [Tony flies over a stormy sea in the chopper. He looks surveillance images on a tablet computer.]\n FRIDAY: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.\n Tony Stark: Did you run facial recognition yet?\n FRIDAY: What do I look like?\n Tony Stark: Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.\n FRIDAY: You must be thinking of someone else.\n Tony Stark: Must be.\n FRIDAY: The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. [Tony projects the image.] Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.\n Tony Stark: So, what happened to the real Broussard?\n FRIDAY: He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.\n Tony Stark: Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.\n FRIDAY: Yes, Boss.\n\n\n [A wide and flat, snow covered landscape. A mountain looms on the horizon. A caterpillar truck stops on the windswept mountain plateau. Zemo gets out of the vehicle. Set on rocks is an entrance with huge, rusted double doors. Zemo hacks away at the wall beside the doors. he uncovers a control panel and keys in a code whilst referring to the red book. The huge, curved double doors break open a crack. Zemo pulls them open wider. He shines a flash light and pulls down the hood of his coat.\n Inside is a vast, gloomy space cramped with shelves stacked with filing boxes. Zemo moves a ladder along and searches the boxes. he climbs up the ladder and removes a filing box labeled: '\u0434\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0440\u044f 1991' (December 1991).\n Zemo walks along a tunnel which opens into a cavernous chamber with a high ceiling. He carries a VHS cassette and a flash light. Standing around the chamber a five large, clear sided capsules. They glow a gold yellow inside. Frowning Zemo walks up to one of the capsules and shines his flash light inside. In the capsule, motionless in a state of suspended animation is the enhanced soldier Josef.]\n\n\n [Tony flies the shopper low over the broiling sea. He operates the chopper with a touch screen computer in a wall panel.]\n Guard: [on radio] This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.\n [The sea swells and surges as Raft Prison rises up from beneath. A huge, fortified, circular structure with small lights around the sides. Two semi-circular doors open up in the flat circular top. The chopper lands on a helipad and the doors close above it. Tony, who's left arm is in a sling walks up to Secretary Ross.]\n Tony Stark: So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.\n Secretary Ross: You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells. [Ross looks at Tony sternly and leads on through a thick, steel security door. Soldiers stand guard in an operations room. Tony looks at a surveillance screen. it shows Wanda, sitting hunched and bedraggled in a cramped prison cell.]\n [Another security door opens. Tony walks into a chamber surrounded by large, bared windows. Beyond the windows are a number of prison cells. Tony takes in his surroundings.]\n Clint Barton: [clapping] The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.\n Tony Stark: Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.\n Clint Barton: [spits] Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.\n Tony Stark: Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .\n Clint Barton: Criminals? [He stands up.] Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for. [He eyes Tony through the bars.] Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.\n Tony Stark: Because you broke the law.\n Clint Barton: Yeah.\n Tony Stark: I didn't make you.\n Clint Barton: La, la, la, la, la . . .\n Tony Stark: You read it, you broke it.\n Clint Barton: La, la, la, la la\u2026\n Tony Stark: Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? [He walks away.]\n Clint Barton: You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.\n Scott Lang: Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.\n Tony Stark: Who are you?\n Scott Lang: Come on, man.\n Sam Wilson: How's Rhodes?\n Tony Stark: They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. [Sam shakes his head.]What do you need? They feed you yet?\n Sam Wilson: [He raises his eyebrows.] You're the good cop now?\n Tony Stark: I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.\n Sam Wilson: Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.\n Tony Stark: Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.\n Secretary Ross: [In the operations room.] What did you do? Get it back up!\n Tony Stark: [Back in the cell.] Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. [He shoes a holographic image of Doctor Broussard.] Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.\n Sam Wilson: That's a first.\n Tony Stark: Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to\u2026\n Sam Wilson: Hey, it's alright. [Tony leans closer to the window. Sam sighs and looks uneasy.] Look, I'll tell you\u2026 but you have to go alone and as a friend.\n Tony Stark: Easy.\n [Tony walks to his chopper.]\n Secretary Ross: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?\n Tony Stark: Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. [Ross stares at Tony who smiles as he gets in the chopper and the door slides shut. The chopper rises off the helipad and flies away. The doors close on the prison roof.]\n [Sitting in the chopper Tony un-clips the sling holding his left arm. He cradles his arm in his hand for a moment. He slowly reaches out the injured arm and presses a button on a panel. The Iron Man Suit wraps itself around Tony, a hatch opens and he flies out of the chopper as Iron Man. He speeds through dark clouds. Close behind T'Challa is at the controls of a Quinjet.]\n\n\n [Steve brings his Quinjet into land besides Zemo's caterpillar truck on the remote icy mountain top. The jet's wings fold up beside the fuselage.\n On board Bucky pulls out rack of guns labeled 'Romanoff'. He takes a light machine gun.\n Bucky and Steve stand together, waiting for the exit ramp to descend.]\n Steve Rogers: You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?\n Bucky Barnes: Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?\n Steve Rogers: You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.\n Bucky Barnes: What was her name again?\n Steve Rogers: Dolores. You called her Dot.\n Bucky Barnes: She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.\n Steve Rogers: So are we, pal. [He clamps his hand on Bucky's shoulder.]\n [Now wearing his helmet Steve walks with Bucky up to the entrance set in rock. The door is still open.]\n Steve Rogers: He can't have been here more than a few hours.\n Bucky Barnes: Long enough to wake them up.\n [Steve leads them into the cast bunker. They travel down into the depths inside a caged elevator. it stops in the bowls of the bunker, doors slide open. Steve nods to Bucky and heaves up the cage door. Bucky readies his heavy duty machine gun and they walk along a corridor, keeping close to a wall. Bucky looks into an alcove full of junk then he and Steve move on up some stairs. At the sound of a loud thud they spin around, aiming down the corridor.]\n Steve Rogers: You ready?\n Bucky Barnes: Yeah.\n [Double doors part, forced open by Iron Man. Steve stares in surprise. Tony walks towards Steve and Bucky and retracts the suit's helmet.]\n Tony Stark: You seem a little defensive.\n [Bucky keeps his gun up while Steve walks to meet Tony with his shield covering his body.]\n Steve Rogers: It's been a long day.\n Tony Stark: At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.\n Steve Rogers: Then why are you here?\n Tony Stark: Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.\n Steve Rogers: Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. [He lowers his shield.] It's good to see you, Tony.\n Tony Stark: You too, Cap. [to Bucky] Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . [Steve signs Bucky to lower his weapon and he does.]\n [the three of them cautiously walk along a corridor. T'Challa in his Black Panther Suit is hiding around a corner, watching them.]\n [With his helmet and face plate reengaged Iron Man leads Steve and Bucky towards the enormous chamber with the capsules standing in it.]\n Tony Stark: I got heat signatures.\n Steve Rogers: How many?\n Tony Stark: Uh, one.\n [As they enter the vast chamber the lights come on. Hazy, yellow mist descends within the capsules. As well as Josef, each one contains an enhanced soldier from the 1991 experiment. Steve and the others look around, bewildered.]\n Helmut Zemo: [on speaker] If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. [All of the enhanced soldiers have been shot in the head. Bucky stares at Josef's corpse.] Did you really think I wanted more of you?\n Bucky Barnes: What the hell?\n Helmut Zemo: I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here. [Zemo appears in a control room. Steve hurls his shield but it flies back.] Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.\n Tony Stark: I'm betting I could beat that.\n Helmut Zemo: Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.\n Steve Rogers: You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? [Black Panther watches from the shadows. Steve looks at Zemo through a window.]\n Helmut Zemo: I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.\n Steve Rogers: You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?\n Helmut Zemo: Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.\n Steve Rogers: [He studies Zemo.] You lost someone?\n Helmut Zemo: [He looks grave, clicks his tongue.] I lost everyone. And so will you. [He plays surveillance footage from December 16th 1991. Steve steps over to the screen.] An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.\n Tony Stark: [He looks at the freeze frame of a secluded road and the date, December 16 1991. His eyes rove, anxiously.] I know that road. What is this?\n\n\n [The video plays. That car that the Winter Soldier forced off the road crashes into a tree. Tony watches intently as the Winter Soldier rides up and gets off his motorbike. Steve watches Tony's increasing unease. The driver lies on the ground beside the car. It's Tony's father, Howard.\n Howard Stark: Help my wife. Please. Help.\n [The Winter Soldier walks over and hoists him up by his hair. He stares at Howard's bloody face. Howard stares back pleadingly.]\n Howard Stark: Sergeant Barnes?\n Maria Stark: Howard!\n [Tony glares at Bucky. In the video the Winter Soldier pounds Howard hard in the face with his metal fist.]\n Maria Stark: Howard!\n [In grief Tony closes his eyes for a moment. On screen his father slumps dead. The Winter Soldier puts him in the driver's seat with his face against the steering wheel. Tony stares in horror. Maria's in the passenger seat with blood streaked down her face. The Winter Soldier walks around and grips her throat. Expressionless he strangles Maria. Tony watches the screen stunned. The Winter Soldier walks up and aims a gun at the surveillance camera.\n\n\n Steve watches Tony anxiously. Tony lunges towards Bucky, Steve stops him.]\n Steve Rogers: Tony. Tony.\n Tony Stark: [Consumed with grief and tears glistening in his eyes he turns and looks at Steve.] Did you know?\n Steve Rogers: I didn't know it was him.\n Tony Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?\n Steve Rogers: Yes.\n [Tony steps back, his chin jutting upwards twitchy. Tony reengages the Iron Man helmet. He punches Steve to the floor and deflects gunfire from Bucky, disarming him. he grabs Bucky and flies across the chamber. He slams him onto the floor, then jumps on his arms. Steve's shield hits Iron Man, distracting him. Steve barges him backwards, Iron Man shoulders him to the floor and shackles his ankles. Bucky punches Iron Man who just lifts him and slams him against a machine. Iron Man raises a fist but Bucky twists it. A rocket shoots out of Iron Man's arm, a fireball explodes. Steve slices his shackles as a towering structure of pipework collapses. Tony and Bucky are thrown down a level as twisted metal falls around them, showering sparks.]\n Steve Rogers: [to Bucky] Get out of here!\n [As Bucky bolts Iron Man fires, but misses. Steve lands in front of him. Bucky hits a control panel and the silo-styled door overhead starts to open.]\n Steve Rogers: It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!\n Tony Stark: Move!\n Steve Rogers: It wasn't him!\n [Steve grabs Iron Man's ankle in mid air and smashes it. Iron Man blocks Steve by shooting down rubble, then falteringly flies up the tower.]\n FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.\n Tony Stark: Ah crap.\n [Above him Bucky leaps from platform to platform. With stuttering jets Iron Man gives chase, then kicks Bucky and takes aim, but the energy bold rebounds off Steve's shield onto himself. Iron Man drops like a stone and lands on a lower platform.]\n Steve Rogers: He's not going to stop. Go.\n [As Iron Man soars upwards, Steve leaps and shoots a wire which wraps around Iron Man's neck and drags him back down. He deflects Steve's shield, then tries to target Bucky.]\n Tony Stark: Come on, come on.\n FRIDAY: Targeting system's knackered, boss.\n Tony Stark: I'm eyeballing it. [His helmet retracts and he shuts one eye, taking aim at the opening hatch. He fires and hits the giant hinge which explodes, cutting of Bucky's escape route. He flies up, blocks two swings from an iron pipe from Bucky, then grabs him around the neck from behind.] Do you even remember them?\n Bucky Barnes: I remember all of them.\n [Bucky pushes them both from the walkway, Steve jumps into them to deflect their fall. Bucky lands on a platform while Tony and Steve land on the concrete floor besides opening in the wall where snow drifts in from outside]\n Steve Rogers: This isn't gonna change what happened.\n Tony Stark: I don't care. He killed my mom.\n [They trade punches and Iron Man ends up pinning Steve down. Bucky picks up Captain America's shield and leaps down to help. As the two super soldiers fist fight with Iron Man the shield changes hands between them until Tony manages to zap Steve who is thrown back into the wall. Bucky struggles to hold Iron Man at bay as he unleashes an energy beam, then he forces Iron Man against the opposite wall and grips the glowing core in the chest of the Iron Man Suit. A blast of energy knocks Bucky down, metal arm completely blown away. Tony zaps him again. Steve rushes him with his shield up and Iron Man fires right at it]\n\n\n [Zemo is outside, listening to a phone message.]\n Zemo's Wife: You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.\n T'Challa: [Sneaks up behind him] I almost kill the wrong man.\n Helmut Zemo: Hardly an innocent one.\n T'Challa: This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.\n Helmut Zemo: [Deletes the voice message] My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, \"Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm.\" When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.\n T'Challa: Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. [He blinks ruefully and retracts the claws in his gloves.] I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.\n Helmut Zemo: [Holding a gun Zemo smiles thinly.] Tell that to the dead. [He tries to shoot himself but T'Challa grabs him just as he fires.]\n T'Challa: The living are not done with you yet.\n\n\n [Tony and Steve are still fighting in the silo.]\n FRIDAY: You can't beat him hand to hand.\n Tony Stark: Analyse his fight pattern.\n FRIDAY: Scanning! [Iron Man's HUD flashes red as Steve lands blow after blow.] Countermeasures ready.\n Tony Stark: [He grabs Captain America's shield.] Let's kick his ass. [He flings the shield away then zaps Steve backwards, head over heels. Steve rises and Tony blocks his punches then zaps him to his knees, right in front of Bucky who's lying on his back.]\n Steve Rogers: He's my friend.\n Tony Stark: So was I. [He punches Steve then throws him back towards the gaps in the wall.] Stay down. Final warning.\n Steve Rogers: [He struggles to his feet, his face bloody and his gate weary. He raises his fists and stares Iron Man down.] I can do this all day.\n [Iron man raises his left palm ready to fire. Bucky grabs his leg and Tony spins, kicking him in the face. Steve grabs Iron Man and lifts him over his head, then throws him down, punches him and bashes his mask off with his shield before striking down hard on the suit's core.Tony looks horrified and glowers fearfully at Steve who pants for breath. Both have blood spattered across their faces. Steve looks back at Tony then shuts his eyes and slumps down. The shield remains upright, stuck upright in the center of the Iron Man Suit. When Steve struggles up again he takes hold of the shield, gripping the edge and pulling it free. He steps away from Tony who rolls painfully onto his side. Bucky lies bloodied but conscious, Steve reaches out and pulls him to his feet, holding him up as Tony looks on.]\n Tony Stark: That shield doesn't belong to you. [Steve turns his back.] You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! [Steve stops, raises his chin, then drops the shield and walks away with Bucky's arm around his shoulder.]\n\n\n [In a secure chamber at the Berlin UN bunker Zemo's contained in a prison pod, his ankles cuffed to his seat. Everett Ross enters the chamber.]\n Everett Ross: Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm? [Zemo just stares.] So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?\n Helmut Zemo: [He looks up to meet Everett's gaze.] Did it?\n\n\n [Back at Avengers HQ, Tony is with Rhodes as he tentatively walks beside parallel bars with tech on his legs.]\n Tony Stark: It's just the first pass.\n James Rhodes: Yeah.\n Tony Stark: Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?\n James Rhodes: You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . [He falls onto his hands.]\n Tony Stark: Let's go. I'll give you a hand.\n James Rhodes: No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me. [He rises to his hands and knees, turns to sit on the floor beside Tony.] 138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. [He gives a crooked smile and takes Tony's hand.]\n Tony Stark: You okay?\n James Rhodes: Oh yeah.\n FedEx Driver Stan Lee: [Knocks on the window with a packet in his hand.] Are you Tony \"Stank\"?\n James Rhodes: Yes, this is--this is Tony \"Stank\". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. \"Stank\". Please, by the bathroom.\n\n\n [Tony is alone, opens the package and finds an envelope and a phone inside.]\n Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . . [As Steve reads his letter off screen it's indicated that he breaks his team out of the Raft.]\n FRIDAY: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.\n Tony Stark: Yeah, put him through.\n Secretary Ross: Tony, we have a problem.\n Tony Stark: Ah, please hold.\n Secretary Ross: No. Don't . . .\n Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.\n\n\n [Wakanda, medical facility.]\n Steve Rogers: You sure about this?\n Bucky Barnes: I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody. [He goes back into cryo.]\n [Steve stands staring through a window, T'Challa walks towards him.]\n Steve Rogers: Thank you for this.\n T'Challa: Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace\u2026\n Steve Rogers: You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.\n T'Challa: Let them try.\n\n\n [In Peter's room on Queens. May speaks to him from somewhere in the apartment.]\n May Parker: So. Who was it? Who hit you?\n Peter Parker: Some guy. So itchy, man. God. [He fiddles with a wrist band.]\n May Parker: What's \"some guy's\" name?\n Peter Parker: Uh, Steve.\n May Parker: Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?\n Peter Parker: No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn. [Peter's wrist band emits a red beam which he hides when his aunt comes into the room.] Ouch.\n May Parker: Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.\n Peter Parker: Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. [May gives him ice in a towel.] That's way better. Thank you.\n May Parker: Okay, tough guy. [She smiles broadly then leaves the room.]\n Peter Parker: Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? [He shines the red beam onto his bedroom ceiling and grins looking up at a glowing image of Spider-Man's mask.]\n [the final screen text shows 'Spider-Man will return']\n [End of Captain America: Civil War]\n\nReferences\n\u2191 https://twitter.com/AerithMonKishu/status/726879470674653184\n\n\u2191 http://buckybare.tumblr.com/post/145538037808/calling-on-the-cacw-fandom\n\n\n\n"

[the doctor looks at Steve\u2019s file which shows he has a long list of health issues]\n4F Doctor: Sorry, son.\nSteve Rogers: Look, just give me a chance.\n4F Doctor: You\u2019d be ineligible on your asthma alone.\nSteve Rogers: Is there anything you can do?\n4F Doctor: I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m saving your life. [He stamps the card 4F.]\n\n\n[later, Steve is at the movie theater]\n[a commercial about the war is playing before the movie]\nCommercial Announcer: War continues to ravage Europe. But help is on the way. Every able-bodied young man is lining up to serve his country. Even little Timmy is doing his part collecting scrap metal. Nice work, Timmy!\nLoud Jerk: Who cares? Play the movie already!\nSteve Rogers: [quietly] Hey, you wanna show some respect?\nCommercial Announcer: Meanwhile, overseas, our brave boys are showing the Axis powers that the price freedom is never too high.\nLoud Jerk: Let\u2019s got! Get on with it! Hey, just start the cartoon!\nSteve Roger: Hey buddy, you wanna shut up?!\n[the guy gets up and looks at him]\nCommercial Announcer: Together with Allied forces, we\u2019ll face any threat, no matter the size.\n[getting beaten in an alley by the loud jerk that was disturbing everyone at the cinema]\nLoud Jerk: You just don\u2019t know when to give up, do you?\nSteve Rogers: I can do this all day. [and attacks the guy again]\nJames Barnes: Hey! Pick on someone your own size.\n[after saving Steve from getting any further beatings by the loud jerk]\nJames Barnes: Sometimes, I think you like getting punched.\nSteve Rogers: I had him on the ropes.\n[picks up Steve\u2019s enlistment form from the ground]\nJames Barnes: How many times is this?\n[reading from the enlistment form]\nJames Barnes: Oh, you\u2019re from Paramus now? You know it\u2019s illegal to lie on the enlistment form. And seriously, Jersey?\nSteve Rogers: You get your orders?\nJames Barnes: The one-o-seventh. Sergeant James Barnes. Shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.\nSteve Rogers: I should be going.\nJames Barnes: Come on, man. My last night! Gotta get you cleaned up.\nSteve Rogers: Why? Where are we going?\nJames Barnes: The future.\n[he hands him the newspaper he was holding, Steve opens it to see the ad for World Exposition Of Tomorrow, 1943]\n\n\nJames Barnes: I don\u2019t see what the problem is. You\u2019re about to be the last eligible man in New York. You know, there\u2019s three and a half million women here.\nSteve Rogers: Well, I\u2019d settle for just one.\nJames Barnes: Good thing I took care of that.\n[He waves to the dates, Connie and Bonnie, he\u2019s lined up]\nConnie: Hey, Bucky!\nSteve Rogers: What did you tell her about me?\nJames Barnes: Only the good stuff.\n[music starts playing]\nExpo Announcer: Welcome to the Modern Marvels Paviliion and the World of Tomorrow. A greater world. A better world.\nConnie: Oh, my God! It\u2019s starting!\nMandy: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Howard Stark!\n[Howard enters the stage and kisses the announcer]\nRandom Woman: I love you, Howard!\nHoward Stark: [addressing the audience at the World Exposition fair] Ladies and gentlemen, what if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile won\u2019t even have to touch the ground at all.\n[the female helpers take the wheels of the car on stage]\nHoward Stark: Yes. Thanks, Mandy. [addressing the audience again] With Stark robotic reversion technology, you\u2019ll be able to do just that.\n[he turns on the switch of his machine and the car starts to hover off the ground]\nJames Barnes: Holy cow.\n[the robots making the car hover suddenly malfunction and the car falls back on stage]\nHoward Stark: I did say a few years, didn\u2019t I?\n[everyone laughs]\n[Steve disappears, and Bucky notices]\nJames Barnes: Hey, Steve, what do you say we treat these girls\u2026\n[at a recruitment center]\nWoman: [to her male company, pulling him away from a mirror making him look like a soldier] Come on, soldier.\n[Steve steps in front of the mirror but he\u2019s too short to fill out the face]\nJames Barnes: Come on. You\u2019re kind of missing the point of a double date. We\u2019re taking the girls dancing.\nSteve Rogers: You go ahead. I\u2019ll catch up with you.\nJames Barnes: You\u2019re really gonna do this again?\nSteve Rogers: Well, it\u2019s a fair. I\u2019m gonna try my luck.\nJames Barnes: As who? Steve from Ohio? They\u2019ll catch you. Or worse, they\u2019ll actually take you.\nSteve Rogers: Look, I know you don\u2019t think I can do this.\nJames Barnes: This isn\u2019t a back alley, Steve. It\u2019s war!\nSteve Rogers: I know it\u2019s a war. You don\u2019t have to tell me.\nJames Barnes: Why are you so keen to fight? There are so many important jobs.\nSteve Rogers: What am I gonna do? Collect scrap metal\u2026\nJames Barnes: Yes!\nSteve Rogers: \u2026in my little red wagon.\nJames Barnes: Why not?\nSteve Rogers: I\u2019m not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.\nJames Barnes: I don\u2019t\u2026\nSteve Rogers: Bucky, come on! There are men laying down their lives. I got no right to do any less than them. That\u2019s what you don\u2019t understand. This isn\u2019t about me.\nJames Barnes: Right. Cause you got nothing to prove.\nConnie: Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?\nJames Barnes: [he turns to the girls] Yes, we are. [back to Steve] Don\u2019t do anything stupid until I get back.\nSteve Rogers: How can I? You\u2019re taking all the stupid with you.\nJames Barnes: You\u2019re a punk.\n[he walks back towards Steve and hugs him goodbye]\nSteve Rogers: Jerk. Be careful.\n[as James is walking away]\nSteve Rogers: Don\u2019t win the war till I get there!\nJames Barnes: [He salutes then starts to walk away] Come on girls. They\u2019re playing our song.\n[Steve is in a medical examination room when a nurse whispers something inaudible to Young Doctor]\nYoung Doctor: Wait here.\nSteve Rogers: Is there a problem?\nYoung Doctor: Just wait here. [walks out]\n[Steve looks at a sign warning against lying on your enlistment form and starts to get ready to leave]\n[An Enlistment Office MP walks in the room and Steve looks up at him worriedly]\n[Dr. Abraham Erskine enters the room as Enlistment Office MP quietly leaves]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: [to the MP] Thank you. [to Steve] So, you want to go overseas. Kill some Nazis.\nSteve Rogers: Excuse me?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Dr. Abraham Erskine. [walks over and introduces himself to Steve] I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.\nSteve Rogers: Steve Rogers.\n[Dr. Erskine starts looking through Steve\u2019s file]\nSteve Rogers: Where are you from?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway. Before that, Germany. This troubles you?\nSteve Rogers: [shakes his head] No.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: [flipping through Steve\u2019s file] Where are you from, Mr. Rogers? Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities.\nSteve Rogers: That might not be the right file.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: No, it\u2019s not the exams I\u2019m interested in. It\u2019s the five tries. But you didn\u2019t answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?\nSteve Rogers: Is this a test?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Yes.\nSteve Rogers: I don\u2019t wanna kill anyone. I don\u2019t like bullies. I don\u2019t care where they\u2019re from.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? I can offer you a chance.\n[They exit the room]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Only a chance.\nSteve Rogers: I\u2019ll take it.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Good. So where is the little guy from, actually?\nSteve Rogers: Brooklyn.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: [Dr. Erskine stamps Steve\u2019s form and hands him back his file] Congratulations, soldier.\n[Steve opens up the file and sees that he\u2019s been stamped as accepted]\n\n\n[In a HYDRA lab in a very mountainous region]\nJohann Schmidt: Are you ready, Dr. Zola?\nDr. Arnim Zola: My machine requires the most delicate calibration. Forgive me if I seem overcautious.\nJohann Schmidt: And are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for a transference?\nDr. Arnim Zola: With this artifact, I am certain of nothing. I fear it may not work at all.\n[Schmidt inserts the Tesseract carefully into the machine. Zola starts it up.]\nDr. Arnim Zola: Twenty percent. Forty. Sixty. Stabilising at 70%.\nJohann Schmidt: [takes over the controls] I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor. [He turns the controls up to maximum and blue light flitters through the room.]\nDr. Arnim Zola: What is that?\n[after successfully collecting the power from the glowing Tesseract using Zola\u2019s machine]\nJohann Schmidt: I must congratulate you, Arnim. Your designs do not disappoint. Though they may require some slight reinforcement.\nDr. Arnim Zola: The exchange is stable. Amazing! The energy we have just collected could power my design, all my designs. This will change the war.\nJohann Schmidt: Dr. Zola, this will change the world.\n\n\n[At a US training camp. Steve stands in line with others.]\nOfficer: [off-screen to other soldiers training] Ready, exercise!\nPeggy Carter: Recruits, attention! Gentlemen, I\u2019m Agent Carter. I supervise all operations for this division.\nGilmore Hodge: What\u2019s with the accent, Queen Victoria? Thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army.\nPeggy Carter: What\u2019s your name, soldier?\nGilmore Hodge: Gilmore Hodge, your Majesty.\nPeggy Carter: Step forward, Hodge.\n[Hodge steps forward, smirking]\nPeggy Carter: Put your right foot forward.\nGilmore Hodge: Mmm\u2026 We gonna wrassle? Cause I got a few moves I know you\u2019ll like.\n[suddenly Peggy punches him hard in the face]\n[Col.Phillips drives up]\nCol. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter.\nPeggy Carter: Colonel Phillips.\nCol. Chester Phillips: I see you\u2019re breaking in the candidates. That\u2019s good! [to Hodge] Get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention 'til somebody comes tells you what to do.\nGilmore Hodge: [he gets back up] Yes, sir.\nCol. Chester Phillips: [addressing the new army recruits] General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men. We are going to win this war because we have the best men\u2026 [he sees Rogers and continues talking] And because they\u2019re gonna get better. Much better. The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world. Our goal is to create the best army in history. But every army starts with one man. At the end of this week we will choose that man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldiers. [While Phillips talk we see scenes of Steve unpacking and training where he fails to keep up and gets bullied by the others.]\nSergeant Duffy: Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!\nCol. Chester Phillips: And they, will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of Hell.\n[then we see Steve and some other trainees running up to a waiting Peggy and a flagpole]\nSergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let\u2019s go! Double time! Come on! Faster! Faster! Move! Move! [they arrive at the flag pole] Squad, halt! That flag means we\u2019re only at the halfway point. First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter. Move, move!\nSoldiers: Come on! Get up there!\nSergeant Duffy: [the soldier try to climb up the pole to no avail] If that\u2019s all you got, this army\u2019s in trouble! Get up there, Hodge! Come on! Get up there! Nobody\u2019s got that flag in 17 years! Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in! Let\u2019s go! Get back into formation! Rogers! I said fall in! [Steve pulls a pin out at the bottom of the pole causing it to fall over.]\nSteve Rogers: [as he gives the flag to Sergeant Duffy] Thank you, sir. [He climbs into the car and they drive away.]\n[The soldiers are doing push-ups.]\nPeggy Carter: Faster, ladies! Come on. My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul. Move it!\nCol. Chester Phillips: [walking besides Erskine] You\u2019re not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.\nCol. Chester Phillips: When you brought a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought, what the hell? Maybe he\u2019ll be useful to you, like a gerbil. I never thought you\u2019d pick him. [referring to Steve]\nPeggy Carter: [as Phillips and Erskine arrive she commands the soldiers:] Up.\nCol. Chester Phillips: You stick a needle in that kids arm and it\u2019s gonna go right through him. [watching Steve struggling whilst training with the other new recruits]\nPeggy Carter: Come on, girls.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Look at that. He\u2019s making me cry.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Do you know how long it took to set up this project?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, I know.\nCol. Chester Phillips: All the groveling I had to do in front of Senator What\u2019s-His-Name\u2019s committees?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him. He\u2019s big, he\u2019s fast, he obeys orders. He\u2019s a soldier.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: He\u2019s a bully.\nCol. Chester Phillips: You don\u2019t win wars with niceness, doctor. [he takes a hand grenade] You win war with guts. [he throws the grenade at where the new recruits are training] Grenade!\n[all the soldiers move away quickly but Steve jumps on top of it covering it with his body]\nSteve Rogers: Get away! Get back! [waits for the grenade to go off but nothing happens]\nOfficer: It was a dummy grenade. All clear. Back in formation.\n[Steve looks at Phillips and Erskine]\nSteve Rogers: Is this is a test?\n[Erskine looks at Phillips as to confirm his point about choosing Steve]\nCol. Chester Phillips: He\u2019s still skinny.\n\n\n[later that night, Steve sits on his bunk reading. Erskine knocks on the door.]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: May I?\nSteve Rogers: Yeah.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Can\u2019t sleep?\nSteve Rogers: I got the jitters, I guess.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: [laughs] Me, too.\nSteve Rogers: Can I ask you a question?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Just one? [he sits down facing Steve]\nSteve Rogers: Why me?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: I suppose that is the only question that matters. [He looks down at the bottle of schnapps he brought with him.] This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi\u2019s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the\u2026 my people struggled. They\u2026 they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the\u2026 and the\u2026 [he waves his hand] And he\u2026 he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, \"You.\" He says, \"You will make us strong.\" Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he\u2019s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.\n[flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine\u2019s formula and injects himself with it]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man.\nSteve Rogers: Did it make him stronger?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.\nSteve Rogers: Thanks. I think.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: [he pours 2 drinks] Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.\n[Steve holds up his glass to toast]\nSteve Rogers: To the little guys.\n[just as Steve\u2019s about to drink from his glass]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: No! No! Wait! Wait! What I am doing? No! You have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.\n[he pours the contents of Steve\u2019s glass into his own]\nSteve Rogers: All right. We\u2019ll drink it after.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: No! I don\u2019t have procedure tomorrow. Drink it after? Drink it now!\n\n\n[At the Hydra facility, in Schmidt\u2019s lab.]\nJohann Schmidt: [he turns off the light] Is there something in particular you need? [An artist is painting Schmidt\u2019s portrait in oil.]\nDr. Arnim Zola: I understand you found him.\nJohann Schmidt: See for yourself. [Zola steps over to the table to find several survaillance photos of Dr. Erskine.] You disapprove.\nDr. Arnim Zola: I just don\u2019t see why you need concern yourself. I can\u2019t imagine he will succeed. [looking nervously at Schmidt] Again.\nJohann Schmidt: His serum is the Allies\u2019 only defence against this power we now possess. If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.\nDr. Arnim Zola: Shall I give the order?\nJohann Schmidt: It has been given.\nDr. Arnim Zola: Good. [he turns to go]\nJohann Schmidt: Dr. Zola. [he turns on the lights] What do you think?\nDr. Arnim Zola: A masterpiece. [the artist looks relieved with Zola\u2019s assessment]\n\n\n[Steve and Peggy whilst driving through Brooklyn]\nSteve Rogers: I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley. And that parking lot. And behind that diner.\nPeggy Carter: Did you have something against running away?\nSteve Rogers: You start running they\u2019ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back. Can\u2019t say no forever, right?\nPeggy Carter: I know a little of what that\u2019s like. To have every door shut in your face.\nSteve Rogers: I guess I just don\u2019t why you\u2019d wanna join the army if you\u2019re a beautiful dame. Or a beautiful\u2026 a woman. An agent, not a dame! You are beautiful, but\u2026\nPeggy Carter: You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?\nSteve Rogers: This is the longers conversation I\u2019ve had with one. Women aren\u2019t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.\nPeggy Carter: You must have danced?\nSteve Rogers: Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. And the past few years just didn\u2019t seem to matter that much. Figured I\u2019d wait.\nPeggy Carter: For what?\nSteve Rogers: The right partner.\n[They pull up by an antiques shop and get out of the car.]\nPeggy Carter: This way.\nSteve Rogers: What are we doing here?\nPeggy Carter: Follow me. [They go inside.]\nAntique Store Owner: Wonderful weather this morning isn\u2019t it?\nPeggy Carter: Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.\n[Peggy leads Steve into the hidden lab to Dr. Erskine and his team in a big circular room filled with machinery and a pod in the middle.]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Good morning. [he shakes Steve\u2019s hand and sombody takes a photograph] Please, not now. [The photographer walks away, Steve looks at the pod] Are you ready? [Steve nods.] Good. Take off your shirt, your tie and your hat.\n[In the adjacent observation chamber filled with officials.]\nCol. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.\nSenator Brandt: Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?\nCol. Chester Phillips: We needed access to the city\u2019s power grid. Of course, if you\u2019d given me the generators I requisitioned\u2026\nSenator Brandt: A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel. [referring to his company] Oh, this is\u2026\nHeinz Kruger: Fred Clemson, State Department. [He shakes Phillips\u2019 hand] If this project of yours comes through, we\u2019d like to see it used for something other than headlines.\nSenator Brandt: [looing down into the chamber at Steve] Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.\n[In the chamber Steve has climbed into the pod and lain down.]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Comfortable?\nSteve Rogers: It\u2019s a little big. You save me any of that schnapps?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Not as much as I should have. Sorry. Next time. Mr. Stark, how are your levels?\nHoward Stark: Levels at 100%.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Good.\nHoward Stark: We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we are ready as we\u2019ll ever be.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Agent Carter? Don\u2019t you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?\nPeggy Carter: Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Good. [He takes a microphone and taps it.] Do you hear me? is this on? [to the small group gathered to watch Steve being prepared to become a super-solider] Ladies and gentlemen, today we take not another step towards annihilation, but the first step on the path to peace. We begin with a series of micro injections into the subjects major muscle groups. The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change. And then to stimulate growth, the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.\nSteve Rogers: [after preliminary injection] That wasn\u2019t so bad.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: That was penicillin. [to the others] Serum infusion beginning in five, four, three, two, one. [The serum is injected into Steve] Now, Mr. Stark. [Stark lowers a leaver, the pod moves upright and encloses Steve inside.] [knocking on the capsule that they\u2019ve locked Steven in for the procedure to change him] Steven, can you hear me?\nSteve Rogers: It\u2019s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?\nDr. Abraham Erskine: [turns to Stark] We will proceed.\nHoward Stark: [manages the controls] That\u2019s ten percent. Twenty percent. Thirty. That\u2019s 40\u00a0%.\nSSR Doctor: Vital signs are normal.\nHoward Stark: That\u2019s 50\u00a0%. Sixty. Seventy.\n[as Steve is screaming in pain as he is receiving the vita rays]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Steven!\nPeggy Carter: Shut it down.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Steven! [he knocks on the pod]\nPeggy Carter: Shut it down!\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark! Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!\nSteve Rogers: No! Don\u2019t! I can do this!\nHoward Stark: Eighty. Ninety. That\u2019s 100\u00a0%. [Everything overloads until the reactor closes itself down.]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Mr. Stark? [Stark opens the pod]\n[after being transformed into a super-soldier]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Steven. Steven.\nCol. Chester Phillips: The son of a bitch did it. [as everyone poors out of the observation chamber Kruger leaves a small, metal object like a cigarett case behind.]\nSteve Rogers: [As he stumbles out of the pod supported by Stark and Erskine] I did it.\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, yeah. I think we did it.\nHoward Stark: We actually did it.\nPeggy Carter: How do you feel?\nSteve Rogers: Taller.\nPeggy Carter: You look taller.\nCol. Chester Phillips: How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?\nSenator Brandt: I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous. Congratulations, Doctor. [He shakes hands with Erskine.]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Thank you, sir.\n[Kruger detonates the bomb in the observation room and uses the confusion to steal the last vial of the serum.]\nDr. Abraham Erskine: Stop him! [Kruger shoots him and flees with Peggy chasing after him]\n[Steve kneels beside Erskine who points at Steve\u2019s chest and dies.]\n[Kruger shoots his way to a get-away-car but soon after he drives away, Peggy shoots the driver and the car crashes into a taxi so Kruger changes cars.]\nTaxi Driver: What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right? Hey, this guy\u2019s been shot!\n[Kruger drives off in the taxi, straight towards Peggy. She shoots at him but he just ducks and keeps going. Steve shoves her out of the way.]\nPeggy Carter. I had him!\nSteve Rogers: Sorry! [he runs after the cab] [While chasing the car he loses control over his new power and crashes into a bridalwear store.] I\u2019m sorry. [he runs out into a street full of cars] Whoa, whoa, whoa!\n[Steve catches up to Kruger\u2019s car a the pier and causes him to lose control. Kruger gets out of the car and takes a young boy hostage.]\nMother: No! No! Not my son!\nYoung Boy: Stop it!\nMother: Don\u2019t hurt him!\nHeinz Kruger: Get back! [Kruger with the boy dangling in his arms runs away.]\nYoung Boy: Let me go!\nMother: Let go of my son! Don\u2019t hurt him!\nSteve Rogers: [as Kruger points a gun at the boy\u2019s head.] Wait, don\u2019t! Don\u2019t! [Kruger points the gun at Steve and pulls the trigger, but the gun is empty. So instead he throws the boy into the water.] No! Don\u2019t! [Kruger runs, Steve looks down at the boy.]\nYoung Boy: Go get him! I can swim!\n[Kruger tries to escape in a submarine, but Steve jumps into the water, breaks the window an pulls Kruger out back onto dry land. As they struggle further the vial breaks.]\nSteve Rogers: Who the hell are you?\nHeinz Kruger: The first of many. Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail HYDRA! [he pops a fake tooth loose and swallows it, he starts to foam at the mouth and then die]\n\n\n[At HYDRA HQ]\nHutter: The F\u00fchrer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt. He funds your research because you promised him weapons.\nSchneider: You serve at his pleasure. He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.\nJohann Schmidt: Reward? Call it what it is. Exile. I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.\nRoeder: You think this is about appearances? Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year. And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.\nSchneider: The F\u00fchrer feels\u2026 How does he put it? \"The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!\"\nJohann Schmidt: Gentlemen, you have come to see the results of our work. Let me show you. [They enter the lab.] Hitler speaks of a thousand-year Reich, but he cannot feed his army for a month. His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe. But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.\nRoeder: And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?\nJohann Schmidt: Science. But I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men. HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. Where ever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.\nRoeder: Your enemies?\nJohann Schmidt: My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Quite simply, gentlemen, I have harnessed the power of the Gods.\nSchneider: Thank you, Schmidt.\nJohann Schmidt: For what?\nSchneider: For making it clear how obviously mad you are.\nHutter: [studying a map lying in Schmidt\u2019s labor.] Berlin is on this map!\nJohann Schmidt: So it is.\nHutter: You will be punished for your insolence! You will be brought before the F\u00fchrer himself! [Schmidt kills them all with his new Tesseract-powered canon.]\nRoeder: [screams before he\u2019s desintegrated] Schmidt!!!\nJohann Schmidt: My apolpgies, Doctor, but we both knew HYDRA could grow no further in Hitler\u2019s shadow. Hail HYDRA.\nHYDRA technicians: Hail HYDRA! [raising both arms to salute]\nDr. Arnim Zola: [when Schmidt turns to him] Hail HYDRA!\n\n\n[At the SSR compound.]\nSteve Rogers: [referring to the amount of blood samples taken from him] Think you got enough?\nPeggy Carter: Any hope of reproducing a program is locked in your genetic code. But without Dr. Erskine, it could take years.\nSteve Rogers: He deserved more than this.\nPeggy Carter: If it could only work once, he\u2019d be proud it was you.\n[SSR tech lab with the Hydra submarine]\nSenator Brandt: Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Great. Why don\u2019t we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car? [to Stark who is working on the submarine] What have we got here?\nHoward Stark: Speaking modestly, I\u2019m the best mechanical engineer in this country. But I don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside this thing or how it works. We\u2019re not even close to this technology.\nSenator Brandt: Then who is?\nCol. Chester Phillips: HYDRA. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been reading our briefings.\nSenator Brandt: I\u2019m on a number of committees, Colonel.\nPeggy Carter: HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It\u2019s led by Johann Schmidt. But he has much bigger ambitions.\nCol. Chester Phillips: HYDRA\u2019s practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, they think he\u2019s invincible.\nSenator Brandt: So what are you gonna do about it?\nCol. Chester Phillips: Spoke to the president this morning. As of today the SSR is being retasked.\nPeggy Carter: Colonel?\nCol. Chester Phillips: We are taking the fight to HYDRA. Pack your bags Agent Carter. You too, Stark. You\u2019re flying to London tonight.\nSteve Rogers: Sir, if you\u2019re going after Schmidt, I want in.\nCol. Chester Phillips: You\u2019re an experiment. You\u2019re going to Alamogordo.\nSteve Rogers: The serum worked.\nCol. Chester Phillips: I asked for an army and all I got was you. You are not enough.\nSenator Brandt: [to Steve] With all due respect to the Colonel, I think we may be missing the point. I\u2019ve seen you in action, Steve. More importantly, the country\u2019s seen it. [to his aide] Paper.[the aide shows them the news paper (\u2018The New York Examiner\u2019 Vol. XCVII No. 33.634, Wednesday, June 23, 1943), headlines: \"Nazis in New York - mystery man saves child\"] The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands. You don\u2019t take a soldier, a symbol like that, and hide him in a lab. Son, do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?\nSteve Rogers: Sir, that\u2019s all I want.\nSenator Brandt: Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.\n\n\nSteve Rogers: [backstage as Steve is getting dressed in super-hero costume] I don\u2019t know if I can do this.\nBrandt\u2019s Aide: Nothing to it. Sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kills Nazi\u2019s. Bing bang boom. You\u2019re an American hero.\nSteve Rogers: It\u2019s just not how I pictured getting there.\nBrandt\u2019s Aide: The senator\u2019s got a lot of pull up on the hill. You play ball with us, you\u2019ll be leading your own platoon in no time. Take the shield. [as Steve puts on his head mask he pushes Steve onto the stage]\nUSO Singer: Who\u2019s strong and brave, here to save the American way?\nSteve Rogers: [As women start to sing and dance in the background Steve reads:] Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank. But there\u2019s still a way all of us can fight.\nUSO Singer: Who vows to fight like a man, for what\u2019s right, night and day?\nSteve Rogers: Series E Defence Bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy\u2019s gun.\nUSO Singer: Who will campaign door-to-door for America? Carry the flag shore to shore for America? From Hoboken to Spokane, the star-spangeld man with a plan.\n[Steve leads a group of men dressed as soldiers in front of a moving image.]\nDirector: Cut. Guys, don\u2019t look ath the camera.\n[back to a scene where he\u2019s on tour.]\nUSO Singer: We can\u2019t ignore there\u2019s a threat and a war we must win.\nSteve Rogers: Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy\u2019s gun.\nUSO Singer: Who\u2019ll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? Who will redeem, heed the call for America? Who\u2019ll rise or fall, give his all for America? Who\u2019s here to prove that we can? The star-spangled man with a plan.\nSteve Rogers: We all know this is about trying to win the war. We can\u2019t do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents. That\u2019s where you come in. Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love. [A men dressed as hitler sneaks up on him on the stage.]\nKids in USO Audience: Turn around! He\u2019s right behind you!\nSteve Rogers: Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us. [The man attacs him and gets fake-punched.]\nUSO Singer: Stalwart and steady and true, forcefull and ready to defend, the red, white, and blue. Who\u2019ll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox? Far as an eagle will soar. Who\u2019s making Adolf afraid to step out of his box? He knows what we\u2019re fighting for. Who waked the giant that napped in America? We know it\u2019s no one but Captain America. Who\u2019ll finish what they began? Who\u2019ll kick the Krauts to Japan? The star-spangled man with a aplan! [Scenes show how Captain America goes on tour around America, appears in comics and films, how he\u2019s approached by multiple fans, and generally becomes more liked and famous.]\n\n\n[Italy, November 1943, 5 miles from the front. Steve addresses a crowd of soldiers dressed in his super-hero costume]\nSteve Rogers: How many of you ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw? [silence from the crowd of soldiers] Okay. Uh\u2026 I need a volunteer.\nArmy Heckler#1: I already volunteered! How do you think I got here? [the crowd of soldiers laugh] Bring back the girls! [there\u2019s a cheer from the soldiers]\nSteve Rogers: I think they only know the one song. But um\u2026let me\u2026I\u2019ll\u2026I\u2019ll see what I can do.\nArmy Heckler#1: You do that, sweetheart.\nArmy Heckler#2: Nice boots, Tinker Bell! [the crowd of soldiers laugh]\nSteve Rogers: Come on, guys. We\u2019re all on the same team here.\nArmy Heckler#3: Hey, Captain! Sign this! [he stands turns and pulls his pants down and the crowd starts to throw things at Steve.]\nArmy Heckler#4: Bring back the girls! [The women run on stage and the crowd cheers.]\nBrandt\u2019s Aide: [backstage to Steve] Don\u2019t worry, pal. They\u2019ll warm up to you. Don\u2019t worry.\n\n\n[Later, Steve sits on the edge of the stage sketching as rain pours down in the background.]\nPeggy Carter: Hello, Steve.\nSteve Rogers: [He turns and looks up at Peggy.] Hi.\nPeggy Carter: Hi.\nSteve Rogers: What are you doin\u2019 here?\nPeggy Carter: Officially I\u2019m not here at all. That was quite a performance.\nSteve Rogers: Yeah. Uh\u2026 I had to improvise a little bit. Crowds I\u2019m used to are usually more uh\u2026 twelve.\nPeggy Carter: I understand you\u2019re \"America\u2019s New Hope\"?\nSteve Rogers: Bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state I visit.\nPeggy Carter: Is that Senator Brandt I hear?\nSteve Rogers: At least he\u2019s got me doin\u2019 this. Phillips would have had be stuck in lab.\nPeggy Carter: And these are your only two options? A lab rat or a dancing monkey? You were meant for more than this, you know? [Steve goes to respond but hesitates] What?\nSteve Rogers: You know for the longest time I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines. Serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted, and I\u2019m wearing tights. [Honking in the background as an ambulance arrives with wounded soldiers. Steve and Peggy turn around to watch.] They look like they\u2019ve been through hell.\nPeggy Carter: These men more than most. Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against him and less than fifty returned. Your audience contained what was left of the one-oh-seventh. The rest were killed or captured.\nSteve Rogers: The one-oh-seventh?\nPeggy Carter: What?\nSteve Rogers: Come on! [They run to a tent.] Colonel Phillips.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Well, if it isn\u2019t the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan. And what is your plan today?\nSteve Rogers: I need the casualty list from Azzano.\nCol. Chester Phillips: You don\u2019t get to give me orders, son.\nSteve Rogers: I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the hundred and seventh.\nCol. Chester Phillips: [pointing to Peggy] You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won\u2019t enjoy.\nSteve Rogers: Please tell me if he\u2019s alive, sir. B-A-R\u2026\nCol. Chester Phillips: I can spell. [referring to Barnes] I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I\u2019m sorry.\nSteve Rogers: What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?\nCol. Chester Phillips: Yeah! It\u2019s called winning the war.\nSteve Rogers: But if you know where they are, why not at least\u2026?\nCol. Chester Phillips: They\u2019re thirty miles behind the lines. Through the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We\u2019d lose more men than we\u2019d save. But I don\u2019t expect you to understand that, because you\u2019re a chorus girl.\nSteve Rogers: I think I understand just fine.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Well then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters correctly, you got some place to be in thirty minutes. [as Phillips walks away Steve looks at the military map which shows where the men are]\nSteve Rogers: Yes, sir. I do.\nCol. Chester Phillips: [To Peggy] If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.\nPeggy Carter: [She follows Steve to his tent where he starts to change and pack some things.] What do you plan to do? Walk to Austria?\nSteve Rogers: If that\u2019s what it takes.\nPeggy Carter: You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.\nSteve Rogers: You don\u2019t know that.\nPeggy Carter: Even so, he\u2019s devising a strategy. If he detects\u2026\nSteve Rogers: By the time he\u2019s done that, it could be too late! [He walks out to a jeep.] You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?\nPeggy Carter: Every word.\nSteve Rogers: Then you gotta let me go. [He gets in the jeep.]\nPeggy Carter: I can do more than that.\n[backstage with the USO girls]\nBrandt\u2019s Aide: On stage, girls. Five minutes!\nUSO girl: Where\u2019s my helmet?\nBrandt\u2019s Aide: Has anyone seen Rogers?\n\n\n[Peggy and Steve in a plane piloted by Stark.]\nPeggy Carter: The HYDRA camp is in Krausberg, tucked between these two mountain ranges. It\u2019s a factory of some kind.\nHoward Stark: We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.\nSteve Rogers: Just get me as close as you can. [referring to Stark and Peggy helping him] You know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab.\nPeggy Carter: And you won\u2019t?\nSteve Rogers: Where I\u2019m goin\u2019, if anybody yells at me I can just shoot \u2018em.\nPeggy Carter: They will undoubtedly shoot back.\nSteve Rogers: Well, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s good for somethin\u2019. [He knocks at his shield.]\nHoward Stark: Agent Carter, if we\u2019re not in too much of a hurry I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late night fondue. [Peggy looks awkwardly at Steve who\u2019s getting ready to parachute.]\nPeggy Carter: Stark is the best civilian pilot I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s mad enough to brave this airspace, we\u2019re lucky to have him.\nSteve Rogers: So are you two\u2026? Do you\u2026? Fondue?\nPeggy Carter: [She ignores Steve\u2019s akward and confused rambling.] This is your transponder. Activate it when you\u2019re ready and the signal will lead us straight to you.\nSteve Rogers: Are you sure this thing works?\nHoward Stark: It\u2019s been tested more than you, pal. [as their plane is being attacked Steve goes towards the opened door of the plane to jump]\nPeggy Carter: Get back here! We\u2019re taking you all the way in.\nSteve Rogers: As soon as I\u2019m free, you turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!\nPeggy Carter: You can\u2019t give me orders!\nSteve Rogers: The hell I can\u2019t! I\u2019m a Captain! [he looks at her and then jumps out of the plane]\n\n\n[In the Hydra factory located in Italy, Schmidt and Zola walk side by side through the workspace.]\nDr. Arnim Zola: As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule, even with components of this size.\nJohann Schmidt: Increase the output by 60\u00a0% and see to it our other facilities do the same.\nDr. Arnim Zola: But the prisoners, I\u2019m not sure they have the strength.\nJohann Schmidt: Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor. There are always more workers.\nDr. Arnim Zola: [To someone approaching him with a clip board] Not now!\n[At the cells where prisoners are lead into. One of the guards knocks the hat from Dumdum Dugan\u2019s head.]\nDum Dum Dugan: You know, Fritz, one of these days, I\u2019m gonna have a stick of my own.\n[Steve runs through the dark woods until he finds a road where trucks a driving by. He gets into the back of one of them and finds himself face to face with two Hydra guards.]\nSteve Rogers: Fellas.\nHYDRA guards: Ah!\n[After Steve snuck into the HYDRA factory and stole a blue shining cartridge, he finds some of the captured American soldiers]\nGabe Jones: Who are you supposed to be?\nSteve Rogers: I\u2019m\u2026 Captain America.\nJames Montgomery Falsworth: I beg your pardon?\nDum Dum Dugan: [After Steve has unlocked their cells and prisoner start pooring out, he says to a Jim Morita, a Japanese looking man] What, are we taking everybody?\nJim Morita: [takes out his dog tags] I\u2019m from Fresno, Ace.\nSteve Rogers: Is there anybody else? I\u2019m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.\nJames Montgomery Falsworth: There\u2019s an isolation ward in the factory, but no one\u2019s ever come back from it.\nSteve Rogers: All right. The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate. Get out fast and give \u2018em hell. I\u2019ll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.\nGabe Jones: Wait! You know what you\u2019re doin\u2019?\nSteve Rogers: Yeah. I\u2019ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over two hundred times.\n[The prisoners escape into the compound, overpowering the guards with their sheer numbers. Dernier picks up one of the new Tesseract-powered HYDRA guns.]\nJim Morita: You know how to use that thing? [Dernier shoots, blowing up a wall] Okay.\n[HYDRA factory command center]\nJohann Schmidt: [stares at a surveillance screen] What is happening? [He presses an alarm.]\n[back to the prisoners in the compound, Dum Dum and Jones overtake a small tank.]\nDum Dum Dugan: Hey. Not exactly a Buick.\nGabe Jones: [points at the controls] That one. Z\u00fcndung. (Ignition.)\nDum Dum Dugan: Z\u00fcndung?\nJames Montgomery Falsworth: [jumps into the tank] Get this thing going, Dugan!\nDum Dum Dugan: [to Jones] I didn\u2019t know you spoke German.\nGabe Jones: Three semesters at Howards, switched to French, girls much cuter.\nDum Dum Dugan: Didn\u2019t ask for the resume.\n[In the HYDRA control room Schmidt watches Steve on the monitors and decides to activate the self destruct sequence which are counting down from 7 minutes.]\nDr. Arnim Zola: No, no! What are you doing?\nJohann Schmidt: Our forces are outmatched. [Zola looks at the screens, then runs out of the room.]\n[Dernier and Morita running through the compound with other prisoners.]\nJim Morita: Keep moving! Grab those grenades!\n\n\n[Schmidt secures the Tesseract while Zola packs the blueprints of his design. Steve sees him in the corridor but hesitates to chase him when he hears someone.]\nJames Barnes: Sergeant. 32557\u2026\nSteve Rogers: [he finds Barnes strapped to a chair in one of Schmidt\u2019s testing labs] Bucky? Oh, my God. [he unstraps him from the chair]\nJames Barnes: Is that\u2026\nSteve Rogers: It\u2019s me. It\u2019s Steve.\nJames Barnes: Steve?\nSteve Rogers: Come on.\nJames Barnes: Steve.\nSteve Rogers: I thought you were dead.\nJames Barnes: I thought you were smaller. [referring to Steve\u2019s change of appearance]\nSteve Rogers: Come on.\nJames Barnes: What happened to you?\nSteve Rogers: I joined the Army. [referring to Steve\u2019s undergoing change to a super-soldier]\nJames Barnes: Did it hurt?\nSteve Rogers: A little.\nJames Barnes: Is it permanent?\nSteve Rogers: So far.\n[They flee through the exploding factory until they meet Schmidt and Zola.]\nJohann Schmidt: Captain America! How exciting! I\u2019m a great fan of your films. So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive. [Steve punches Schmidt hard in the face]\nSteve Rogers: You\u2019ve got no idea.\nJohann Schmidt: Haven\u2019t I? [He goes to hit Steve but Steve protects himself with his shield. As they fight, Zola pulls a leaver and the catwalk they are standing on retracts to either side seperating them.] No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see I was his greatest success! [he peels off the skin on his face to reveal that he is the Red Skull]\nJames Barnes: [to Steve referring to Schmidt\u2019s skinless face] You don\u2019t have one of those, do you?\nJohann Schmidt: You are deluded, Captain. You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. Unlike you, I embrace it proudly. Without fear!\nSteve Rogers: Then how come you\u2019re running? [Schmidt and Zola continue their escape and so do Steve and Bucky.] Come on, let\u2019s go. Up.\n[Schmidt and Zola in an elevator.]\nDr. Arnim Zola: Sir? Are we going to the roof? [The doors open to reveal a one-man-plane] What about me? Where will I sit?\nJohann Schmidt: [gives Zola his car keys] Not a scratch, Doctor. Not a scratch. [We see Schmidt and Zola escaping.]\n[Steve and Bucky on a catwalk, beneath them everything is on fire, they have to reach the other side of the room over a thin gantry.]\nSteve Rogers: Let\u2019s go. One at a time. [Bucky reaches the other side but the gantry collapses behind him.]\nJames Barnes: Gotta be a rope or something!\nSteve Rogers: Just go! Get out of here!\nJames Barnes: No! Not without you! [Steve jumps over the chasm.]\n\n\n[In the Amry camp Phillips is dictating a letter to a Corporal.]\nCol. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action. Period.\nPeggy Carter: The last surveillance flight is back. No sign of activity.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.\nCorporal: Yes, sir. [he leaves]\nCol. Chester Phillips: I can\u2019t touch Stark. He\u2019s rich and he\u2019s the Army\u2019s number one weapons contractor. You are neither one.\nPeggy Carter: With respect, sir, I don\u2019t regret my actions. And I don\u2019t think Captain Rogers did either.\nCol. Chester Phillips: What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions. I took a chance with you, Agent Carter. And now America\u2019s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead, cause you had a crush.\nPeggy Carter: It wasn\u2019t that. I had faith.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Well, I hope that\u2019s a big comfort to you when they shut this division down. [Soldier start running and talking exitedly in the background.] What the hell\u2019s going on out there? [They follow the crowd to the edge of the camp where Steve\u2019S arriving with the freed prisoners.]\nMan#1: Look who it is! [everyone cheers]\nSteve Rogers: [salutes to Phillips] Some of theres men need medical attention.\nMan#2: Medic, we got wounded.\nMedic. Right over here.\nSteve Rogers: I\u2019d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.\nCol. Chester Phillips: That won\u2019t be necessary.\nSteve Rogers: Yes, sir.\nCol. Chester Phillips: [he turns and walks away from Steve and he notices Peggy] Faith, huh?\nPeggy Carter: [to Steve] You\u2019re late.\nSteve Rogers: [holding up the broken transponder] Couldn\u2019t call my ride.\nJames Barnes: [to the men] Hey! Let\u2019s hear it for Captain America. [more cheering]\n\n\nSenator Brandt: [somwhere in America tlaking to a small crowd] I am honoured to present this medal for valour to my personal friend, Captain America! [he turns around but no one is there.] Captain America! [still nothing] Captain, that\u2019s your cue! [his aide comes out, whispering something to him]\nGeneral: [sitting in the crowd talking quietly to the man next to him] I thought he\u2019d be taller. [misunderstanding the aide to be Captain America]\n[Allied HQ in London]\nSteve Rogers: The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic. [he marks it on a map] And the sixth one was\u2026 about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line. [a soldier takes the map away] I just got a quick look.\nPeggy Carter: Well, nobody\u2019s perfect. [they walk over to Phillips and another map]\nSteve Rogers: These are the weapon factories we know about. Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn\u2019t on this map.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.\nPeggy Carter: What about us?\nCol. Chester Phillips: We are gonna set a fire under Johann Schmidt\u2019s ass. What do you say, Rogers? It\u2019s your map, you think you can wipe Hydra off of it?\nSteve Rogers: Yes, sir. I\u2019ll need a team.\nCol. Chester Phillips: We\u2019re already putting together the best men.\nSteve Rogers: With all due respect, sir. So am I.\n[in a bar]\nDum Dum Dugan: So, let\u2019s get this straight.\nGabe Jones: We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?\nSteve Rogers: Pretty much.\nJames Montgomery Falsworth: Sounds rather fun, actually.\nJim Morita: [belches] I\u2019m in.\nGabe Jones: [Dernier and Gabe speaking French, Dernier laughs, they shake hands] We\u2019re in.\nDum Dum Dugan: Hell, I\u2019ll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.\nSteve Rogers: What\u2019s that?\nDum Dum Dugan: Open a tab.\nJim Morita: Well, that was easy.\nSteve Rogers: [Steve goes over to the bar.] Another round.\nBarkeeper: Where are they putting all this stuff?\n\n\nJames Barnes: [Steve joins Bucky at the barcounter. In the background everyone's singing \"There's a Tavern in Town\"[1]] See? I told you. They\u2019re all idiots.\nSteve Rogers: How about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?\nJames Barnes: Hell, no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight. I\u2019m following him. But you\u2019re keeping the outfit, right?\nSteve Rogers: You know what? It\u2019s kind of growing on me.\nPeggy Carter: [The singing in the bar stops as Peggy in a tight fitting, deep-red dress walks in.] Captain.\nSteve Rogers: Agent Carter.\nJames Barnes: Ma\u2019am.\nPeggy Carter: Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?\nSteve Rogers: Sounds good.\nPeggy Carter: I see you top squad is prepping for duty.\nJames Barnes: You don\u2019t like music?\nPeggy Carter: I do, actually. I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.\nJames Barnes: Then what are we waiting for?\nPeggy Carter. The right partner. 0800, Captain.\nSteve Rogers: Yes, ma\u2019m. I\u2019ll be there.\nJames Barnes: [referring to the rejection he got from Peggy about going dancing with him] I\u2019m invisible. I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m turning into you. It\u2019s like some horrible dream.\nSteve Rogers: Don\u2019t take it so hard. Maybe she\u2019s got a friend. [whilst waiting to see Stark]\n\n\nHoward Stark: [Morning, by a glass chamber, Stark examines the Hydra cartridge] Emission signature is unusual. Alpha and beta ray neutral. Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that. Seems harmless enough. Hard to see what all the fuss is about. [He removes a glowing pellet. The blast sends Stark and his engineer flying across the room.] Write that down.\n[Somwhere else in the building]\nSteve Rogers: [to Private Lorraine] Excuse me. I\u2019m looking for Mr. Stark.\nPvt. Lorraine: He\u2019s in with Colonel Phillips. Of course you\u2019re welcome to wait. [Steve perches on the edge of a desk to wait] I read about what you did. [she holds up the newspaper showing his rescue mission]\nSteve Rogers: Oh! The\u2026yeah! Well, that\u2019s you know? Just doin\u2019 what needed to be done.\nPvt. Lorraine: Sounded like more than that. You saved nearly four hundred men.\nSteve Rogers: Really, it\u2019s not a big deal.\nPvt. Lorraine: Tell that to their wives. [Steve gets nervous as she walks up to him]\nSteve Rogers: Uh\u2026I don\u2019t think they were all married.\nPvt. Lorraine: You\u2019re a hero.\nSteve Rogers: Well, that\u2026you know? That\u2026that depends on the definition of it really. [she grabs hold of his tie]\nPvt. Lorraine: The women of America, they owe you their thanks. And uh\u2026seeing as they\u2019re not here. [drags him to the corner of the office and kisses him]\nPeggy Carter: [she walks in] Captain! [Steve and Pvt. Lorraine seperate] We\u2019re ready for you. If you\u2019re not otherwise occupied. [annoyed, she turns and walks ahead]\nSteve Rogers: Agent Carter, wait.\nPeggy Carter: Looks like finding a partner wasn\u2019t that hard after all.\nSteve Rogers: Peggy, that\u2019s not what you thought it was.\nPeggy Carter: I don\u2019t think anything, Captain. Not one thing. You always wanted to be soldier and now you are. Just like all the rest.\nSteve Rogers: Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven\u2019t been\u2026 fonduing?\nPeggy Carter: [she turns to look at him] You still don\u2019t know a bloody thing about women!\n[In Stark\u2019s lab]\nHoward Stark: Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.\nSteve Rogers: Really? I didn\u2019t think\u2026\nHoward Stark: Nor should you, pal. The moment you think you know what\u2019s goin\u2019 on in a woman\u2019s head, it\u2019s the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed. Carbon polymer. [referring to a piece of cloth lying on the table] Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although Hydra\u2019s not going to attack you with a pocket knife. [referring to Steve\u2019s Captain America shield] I hear you\u2019re uh\u2026 kinda attached?\nSteve Rogers: It\u2019s handier than you might think.\nHoward Stark: I took the liberty of coming up with some options. [shows him a few shields] This one\u2019s fun. She\u2019s been fitted with electrical relays. It\u2019ll allow you to\u2026\nSteve Rogers: What about this one? [he picks up a round silver looking shield]\nHoward Stark: No! No! That\u2019s just a prototype.\nSteve Rogers: What\u2019s it made of?\nHoward Stark: Vibranium. It\u2019s stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It\u2019s completely vibration absorbent.\nSteve Rogers: How come it\u2019s not a standard issue?\nHoward Stark: That\u2019s the rarest metal on earth. What you\u2019re holding there? That\u2019s all we\u2019ve got.\nPeggy Carter: [as Steve is checking out the shield made out of Vibranium] You quite finished, Mr. Stark? I\u2019m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.\nSteve Rogers: [holds up the Vibranium shield against him] What do you think? [Peggy picks up gun and shoots it at Steve as he quickly holds up the shield to protect himself]\nPeggy Carter: Yes. I think it works. [she puts the gun down and walks out of the lab, Steve and Howard looking at her stunned]\nSteve Rogers: I had some ideas about the uniform. [gives Stark a piece of paper]\nHoward Stark: [takes it] Whatever you want, pal.\n\n\n[Montage of Captain America and his Howling Commandos fighting Hydra.]\n[At the site of a destroyed Hydra base]\nJohann Schmidt: You are failing! We are close to an offensive network that will shake the planet. And yet we are continually delayed, because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!\nDr. Arnim Zola: This is hardly my area of expertise. I\u2026I merely develop the weapons. I\u2026I cannot fire them.\nJohann Schmidt: Finish your mission, Doctor. Before the American finishes his.\nGuard: [two guards arrive with the facility manager] Sir!\nFacility Manager: I\u2019m sorry, Herr Schmidt. We fought to the last man.\nJohann Schmidt: Evidently not. [kills him]\n\n\nJames Barnes: [On a snow covered mountain the Howling Commandos prepare to zipline onto the train.] Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?\nSteve Rogers: Yeah, I and I threw up?\nJames Barnes: This isn\u2019t payback, is it?\nSteve Rogers: Now why would I do that?\nGabe Jones: We were right. Dr. Zola\u2019s on the train. Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle. Wherever he\u2019s going, they must need him bad.\nJames Montgomery Falsworth: Let\u2019s get going, because they\u2019re moving like the devil.\nSteve Rogers: We only got about a 10-second window. You miss that window, we\u2019re bugs on a windshield.\nJames Montgomery Falsworth: Mind the gap.\nDum Dum Dugan: Better get moving, bugs!\nJacques Dernier: Maintenant! (Now!) [ Steve, Bucky and Gabe zippline onto the train.]\nDr. Arnim Zola: [watching Steve on a monitore, fighting his way through the train] Stop him! Fire again!\nJames Barnes: [after Steve helps him out] I had him on the ropes.\nSteve Rogers: I know you did. [another trooper with a blaster appears] Get down!\nDr. Arnim Zola: Fire again! Kill him! Now!\nSteve Rogers: [Bucky\u2019s been blasted through a hole and is now hanging outside the train.] Bucky! Hang on! Grab my hand! NO!\n\n\n[Allied HQ in London, Phillips brings a tray of food to Zola after he\u2019s been captured and imprisoned]\nCol. Chester Phillips: Sit down.\nDr. Arnim Zola: What is this?\nCol. Chester Phillips: Steak.\nDr. Arnim Zola: What is in it?\nCol. Chester Phillips: Cow. Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?\nDr. Arnim Zola: I don\u2019t eat meat.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Why not?\nDr. Arnim Zola: It disagrees with me.\nCol. Chester Phillips: How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy too? Every Hydra agent that we\u2019ve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you. So, here\u2019s my brilliant theory. [Phillips starts eating the steak.] You wanna live.\nDr. Arnim Zola: You\u2019re trying to intimidate me, Colonel.\nCol. Chester Phillips: I bought you dinner. [passes him a piece of paper which Zola reads out loud]\nDr. Arnim Zola: \u2018Given the variable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.\u2019\nCol. Chester Phillips: I sent that message to Washington this morning. Of course it was encoded. You guys haven\u2019t broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.\nDr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt will know this is a lie.\nCol. Chester Phillips: He\u2019s gonna kill you anyway, Doc. You\u2019re a liability. You know more about Schmidt than anyone. And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers\u2019 closest friend. So, I wouldn\u2019t count on the very best of protection. There\u2019s you or Schmidt. It\u2019s just the hand you\u2019ve been dealt.\nDr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt believes he walks in the foot steps of the Gods.\nCol. Chester Phillips: Mmm.\nDr. Arnim Zola: Only the world itself will satisfy him.\nCol. Chester Phillips: You do realize that\u2019s nuts, don\u2019t you?\nDr. Arnim Zola: But the sanity of the plan is of no consequence.\nCol. Chester Phillips: And why is that?\nDr. Arnim Zola: Because he can do it!\nCol. Chester Phillips: What\u2019s his target?\nDr. Arnim Zola: His target\u2026 is everywhere.\n\n\n[Hydra main base, Schmidt adresses his soldier]\nJohann Schmidt: Tomorrow, Hydra will stand master of the world. Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie. Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us. If they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them! If they cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail Hydra! [his soldiers all start saluting and shouting \u2018Hail Hydra\u2019]\n\n\n[In London, a part of the city destroyed by bombs, formerly the bar where Steve enlisted the Howling Commandos. Peggy follows the voice of a radio through the rubble.]\nMan on the Radio: Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area. Please wait for the all-clear. Your attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice. Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.\nSteve Rogers: [when Peggy finds him he\u2019s pouring himself some drink] Dr. Erskine said that\u2026 the serum wouldn\u2019t just effect my muscles, it would effect my cells. Create a protective system of regeneration and healing. Which means um\u2026I can\u2019t get drunk. Did you know that?\nPeggy Carter: Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. He thought it could be one of the side effects. [referring to Barnes getting killed] It wasn\u2019t your fault.\nSteve Rogers: Did you read the reports?\nPeggy Carter: Yes.\nSteve Rogers: Then you know that\u2019s not true.\nPeggy Carter: You did everything you could. Did you believe in your friend? Did you respect him? [Steve looks at her as if to say yes] Then stop blaming yourself. Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice. He damn well must have thought you were worth it.\nSteve Rogers: I\u2019m goin\u2019 after Schmidt. I\u2019m not gonna stop till all of Hydra is dead or captured.\nPeggy Carter: You won\u2019t be alone.\n\n\n[The team prepare a battle plan to take down Red Skull at his headquarters]\nCol. Chester Phillips: Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house. He thinks he\u2019s a God. He\u2019s willing to blow up half the world to prove it, starting with the USA.\nHoward Stark: Schmidt\u2019s working with powers beyond our capabilities. He gets across the Atlantic, he will wipe out the entire eastern sea board in an hour.\nGabe Jones: How much time we got?\nCol. Chester Phillips: According to my new best friend, under twenty four hours.\nJaques Dernier: Where is he now?\nCol. Chester Phillips: Hydra\u2019s last base is here. [holding a photo he points to the base] In the Alps. Five hundred feet below the surface.\nJim Morita: So, what are we supposed to do. I mean, it\u2019s not like we can just knock on the front door.\nSteve Rogers: Why not? That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re gonna do.\n\n\n[after Steve has been captured by Hydra soldiers and brought to Schmidt\u2019s weapon lab]\nJohann Schmidt: Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait, but I must say you do it better than anyone. But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain. Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?\nSteve Rogers: He told me you were insane.\nJohann Schmidt: Ah. He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. But he gave you everything. So, what made you so special?\nSteve Rogers: Nothin\u2019. I\u2019m just a kid from Brooklyn. [after Schmidt has beaten him] I can do this all day.\nJohann Schmidt: Oh, of course you can. Of course. But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule. [Schmidt takes out his cube-energy pistol and points it at Steve]\nSteve Rogers: So am I! [just then Steve\u2019s team crashes through the windows of the weapons lab]\nJames Montgomery Falsworth: Rogers! You might need this! [He throws Steve his shield.]\nSteve Rogers: Thanks! [Steve makes his way through the Hydra base which has fallen into chaos with the arrival of more Allied soldiers.]\nJim Morita: [into his comm] We\u2019re in! Assault team, go!\nCol. Chester Phillips: [standing outside listening to Morita] Move out! [the soldiers start running towards the Hydra base] Keep your spacing!\n\n\n[In the Hydra base]\nHydra Soldier: Cutt off one head, two more shall\u2026 [he\u2019s killed by Phillips]\nCol. Chester Phillips: Let\u2019s go find two more!\n[As Steve chases Schmidt he is confronted by a Hydra soldier with flame throwers and saved by Peggy]\nSteve Rogers: [after Peggy has killed the Hydra soldier] You\u2019re late.\nPeggy Carter: Weren\u2019t you about to\u2026\nSteve Rogers: Right. [Steve continues his chase, but after Schmidt has boarded the Valkyrie Steve is not fast enough to catch the plane. Behin him Phillips and Peggy appear in a car and pick him up to chase the plane on the runway.] Keep it steady! [Just as Steve is about to leap from the roadster onto Schmidt\u2019s plane Peggy stops him]\nPeggy Carter: Wait! [she kisses him] Go get him. [Steve surprised by the kiss looks at Phillips]\nCol. Chester Phillips: I\u2019m not kissin\u2019 you!\n\n\n[Inside the Valkyrie there are multiple figher planes with their targets written on them: Boston, Chicago, New York. After Steve has managed to disable the fighter planes and their pilots he enters the cockpit where Schmidt is waiting.]\nJohann Schmidt: You don\u2019t give up, do you?\nSteve Rogers: Nope! [They fight]\nJohan Schmidt: You could have the power of the gods! Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations! I have seen the future, Captain! There are no flags!\nSteve Rogers: Not my future! [He flings his shield at Schmidt who is thrown into the cubic console.]\nJohan Schmidt/Red Skull: What have you done? No. [he picks up the cube and energy starts to pour from it, revealing a window into space. A stream of blue energy engulfes Schmidt and takes him into the sky. The cube falls to the ground and burns through it until it falls into the sea below.]\n\n\n[Steve takes over the plane\u2019s controls, on a screen he reads \"Ziel New York City\" (target New York City), and tries the radio which is picked up by the Hydra control tower occupied by Peggy, Phillips and Morita.]\nSteve Rogers: Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?\nJim Morita: Captain Rogers, what is your\u2026 [Peggy takes his place]\nPeggy Carter: Steve, is that you? Are you alright?\nSteve Rogers: Peggy! Schmidt\u2019s dead.\nPeggy Carter: What about the plane?\nSteve Rogers: That\u2019s a little bit tougher to explain.\nPeggy Carter: Give me your coordinates, I\u2019ll find you a safe landing site.\nSteve Rogers: There\u2019s not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down.\nPeggy Carter: I\u2019ll get Howard on the line, he\u2019ll know what to do.\nSteve Rogers: There\u2019s not enough time. This thing\u2019s moving too fast and it\u2019s heading for New York. [referring to Schmidt\u2019s plane, speaking through the plane\u2019s control] I gotta put her in the water.\nPeggy Carter: Please, don\u2019t do this. We have time. We can work it out.\nSteve Rogers: Right now I\u2019m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. Peggy, this is my choice. [as he\u2019s forcing the plane down towards the water] Peggy?\nPeggy Carter: I\u2019m here.\nSteve Rogers: I\u2019m gonna need a rain check on that dance.\nPeggy Carter: [with tears in her eyes] Alright. A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.\nSteve Rogers: You got it.\nPeggy Carter: Eight o\u2019clock on the dot. Don\u2019t you dare be late. Understood?\nSteve Rogers: You know, I still don\u2019t know how to dance.\nPeggy Carter: I\u2019ll show you how. Just be there.\nSteve Rogers: We\u2019ll have the band play somethin\u2019 slow. I\u2019d hate to step on your\u2026 [the line goes static and Peggy begins to cry]\nPeggy Carter: Steve? Steve? Steve?\n[Later, the world celebrates the victory over Nazi-Germany. The Howling Commandos are in a bar.]\nJames Montgomery Falsworth: To the Captain. [They drink]\n\n\n[Stark on his search for the Valkyrie in the arctic sea on a ship. They\u2019ve found the Tesseract.]\nStark\u2019s Engineer: Sir? [Stark steps to him and watches on a screen how a submarine grabs the cube.]\nHoward Stark: [to the captain] Take us to the next grid point.\nStark\u2019s Engineer: But there\u2019s not trace of wreckage. And the energy signature stops here.\nHoward Stark: Just keep looking.\n\n\n[After Steve has been missing for some time, we see him awaken in a 1940\u2019s hospital and he can hear a baseball game on an old radio when a woman walks into the room]\nDodgers Announcer: [over the radio] Curve ball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat, this fellow\u2019s capable of making it a brand-new game again. Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field. The Phillies have managed to tie up at 4-4. But the Dodgers have three men on. Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month. Wouldn\u2019t the youngster like a hit here to return the favour? Pete leans in. Here\u2019s the pitch. Swung on. A line to the right. And it gets past Rizzo. Three runs will score. Reiser heads to third. Durocher\u2019s going to wave him in. Here comes the relay, but they won\u2019t get him. [the door opens and an agent walks in]\nSHIELD Agent: Good morning. [she checks her watch] Or should I say, afternoon?\nSteve Rogers: Where am I?\nSHIELD Agent: You\u2019re in a recovery room in New York city.\nDodgers Announcer: The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4. Oh, Dodgers! Everyone is on their feet. What a game we have here today, folks. What a game indeed.\nSteve Rogers: [he looks at her suspiciously] Where am I really?\nSHIELD Agent: I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand.\nSteve Rogers: The game, it\u2019s from May, nineteen forty one. I know, cause I was there. [he gets up from the bed] Now, I\u2019m gonna ask you again. Where am I?\nSHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers\u2026 [she secretly pushes an alarm]\nSteve Rogers: Who are you? [two soldiers in black uniform enter the room and Steve knocks them through the wall. Steve realizes that he\u2019s on a some kind of made up set and he runs out of there.]\nSHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers, wait! [into a comm] All agents, code 13! I repeat. All agents, code 13!\n[Steve finds himself in 2011\u2019s Time Square he looks around him in shock, numerous SUV\u2019s encircle him and Fury steps out of one of the vehicles]\nNick Fury: At ease, soldier! Look, I\u2019m sorry about that little show back there, but\u2026 we thought it best to break it to you slowly.\nSteve Rogers: Break what?\nNick Fury: You\u2019ve been asleep, Cap. For almost seventy years. [Steve looks around him in shock] You gonna be okay?\nSteve Rogers: Yeah. Yeah.

It's good to meet you, Sam.\n[as Steve turns to leave]\nSam Wilson: It's your bed, right?\nSteve Rogers: What's that?\nSam Wilson: Your bed, it's too soft. When I was over there I'd sleep on the ground and use rock for pillows, like a caveman. Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like...\nSteve Rogers: Lying on a marshmallow.

What the hell are you doing here?\n[Steve goes over to Natasha and looks at what Natasha is backing up]\nSteve Rogers: You're saving SHIELD Intel.\nNatasha Romanoff: Whatever I can get my hands on.\nSteve Rogers: Our mission is to rescue hostages.\nNatasha Romanoff: No. That's your mission.\n[she finishes backing up and pulls the flash drive out]\nNatasha Romanoff: And you've done it beautifully.\n[as Natasha goes to leave Steve grabs her arm]\nSteve Rogers: You just jeopardized this whole operation.\nNatasha Romanoff: I think that's overstating things.\n[suddenly Batroc rises and throws a grenade at the two as he runs off, Steve deflects the bomb with his shield, grabs Natasha and jumps through a window before it explodes]\nNatasha Romanoff: Okay. That one's on me.\nSteve Rogers: You're damn right.\n[Steve gets up and leaves in anger]\n\n\n[The Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters; Steve walks into Fury's office]\nSteve Rogers: You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?\nNick Fury: I didn't lie. Agent Romanoff had a different mission than yours.\nSteve Rogers: Which you didn't feel obliged to share.\nNick Fury: I'm not obliged to do anything.\nSteve Rogers: Those hostages could've died, Nick.\nNick Fury: I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn't happen.\nSteve Rogers: Soldiers trust each other, that's what makes it an army. Not a bunch of guys running around and shooting guns.\nNick Fury: The last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye. Look, I didn't want you doing anything you weren't comfortable with. Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything.\nSteve Rogers: I can't lead a mission when the people I'm leading have missions of their owns.\nNick Fury: It's called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all.\nSteve Rogers: Except you.\nNick Fury: You're wrong about me. I do share. I'm nice like that.\n[Fury steps into an elevator with Steve following behind him]\nNick Fury: Insight bay.\nSHIELD Computer: Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight.\nNick Fury: Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.\nSHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\n[the elevator starts moving down]\nSteve Rogers: You know, they used to play music.\nNick Fury: Yeah. My grandfather operated one of these things for forty years. My granddad worked in a nice building, he got good tips. He'd walk home every night, roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag. He'd say \"hi\", people would say hi back. Time went on, neighborhood got rougher. He'd say \"Hi\", they'd say, \"Keep on steppin'.\" Granddad got to grippin' that lunch bag a little tighter.\nSteve Rogers: Did he ever get mugged?\nNick Fury: Every week some punk would say, \"What's in the bag?\"\nSteve Rogers: What did he do?\nNick Fury: He'd show 'em. Bunch of crumpled ones and loaded .22 Magnum.\n[Fury smiles]\nNick Fury: Granddad loved people. But he didn't trust them very much.\n[as they continue to ride down the elevator Steve notices the giant Helicarriers]\nNick Fury: Yeah, I know. They're a little bit bigger than a .22.\n[as Fury shows Steve round]\nNick Fury: This is Project Insight. Three next generation Helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites.\nSteve Rogers: Launched from the Lemurian Star.\nNick Fury: Once we get them in the air they never need to come down. Continuous suborbital flight courtesy of our new repulsor engines.\nSteve Rogers: Stark?\nNick Fury: Well, he had a few suggestions once he got an up close look at our old turbines. These new long range precision guns can eliminate a thousand hostiles a minute. The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.\nSteve Rogers: I thought the punishment usually came after the crime.\nNick Fury: We can't afford to wait that long.\nSteve Rogers: Who's \"we\"?\nNick Fury: After New York, I convinced the World Security Council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis. For once we're way ahead of the curve.\nSteve Rogers: By holding a gun at everyone on Earth and calling it protection.\nNick Fury: You know, I read those SSR files. Greatest generation? You guys did some nasty stuff.\nSteve Rogers: Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it so the people could be free. This isn't freedom, this is fear.\nNick Fury: SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. It's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap.\nSteve Rogers: Don't hold your breath.\n[Steve turns and walks off]\n\n\n[Steve takes off on his motorcycle; in the Smithsonian Museum there is an exhibit dedicated to Captain America]\nThe Smithsonian Narrator: A symbol to the nation. A hero to the world. The story of Captain America is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice.\n[Steve, keeping his face hidden under a baseball cap, walks over to the exhibition]\nWoman on PA: Welcome to the Smithsonian. Visitor information booths are available on the second level.\nThe Smithsonian Narrator: Denied enlistment due to poor health, Steven Rogers was chosen for a program unique in the annals of American warfare. One that would transform him into the world's first super soldier.\n[a boy recognizes him, Steve smiles puts his finger against his mouth to indicate for the boy to keep quiet and the boy nods, Steve then watches an old footage of himself]\nOld Footage Recording: In this rare footage, everyone's favorite warrior, Captain America...\n[Steve goes to the display where there are mannequins with costumes of Steve's old commando squad]\nThe Smithsonian Narrator: Battle tested, Captain America and his Howling Commandos quickly earned their stripes. Their mission, taking down HYDRA, the Nazi rogue science division.\n[Steve walks over to the a display of his friend Bucky Barnes]\nThe Smithsonian Narrator: Best friends since childhood, Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable on both schoolyard and battlefield. Barnes is the only Howling Commando to give his life in service of his country.\n[Steve watches an older looking Peggy Carter being interviewed]\nPeggy Carter: That was a difficult winter. A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line. Steve...Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months. He saved over a thousand men, including the man who would...who would become my husband as it turned out. Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life.\n[Steve looks at the photo of Peggy he'd kept in his old compass]\n\n\n[Steve visits Peggy, who is now lying sick in bed]\nSteve Rogers: You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.\n[Steve looks at Peggy's family photos by her bedside table showing her with her husband and children]\nPeggy Carter: Mm. I have lived a life. My only regret is that you didn't get to live yours.\n[Steve looks sad]\nPeggy Carter: What is it?\nSteve Rogers: For as long as I can remember I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I'm not quite sure what that is anymore. And I thought I could throw myself back in and follow orders, serve. It's just not the same.\n[Peggy chuckles]\nPeggy Carter: You're always so dramatic. Look, you saved the world. We rather...mucked it up.\nSteve Rogers: You didn't. Knowing that you helped found SHIELD is half the reason I stay.\n[Peggy takes Steve's hand]\nPeggy Carter: Hey. The world has changed and none of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over.\n[Peggy starts to cough, Steve turns to get her some water and goes to hand it to her]\nSteve Rogers: Peggy.\n[suddenly Peggy looks at Steve like she's seeing for the first time since he was frozen]\nPeggy Carter: Steve?\nSteve Rogers: Yeah.\nPeggy Carter: You're alive! You...you came, you came back.\nSteve Rogers: Yeah, Peggy.\n[Peggy begins to cry]\nPeggy Carter: It's been so long. So long.\nSteve Rogers: Well, I couldn't leave my best girl. Not when she owes me a dance.\n\n\n[Fury is alone in his office; to his voice controlled computer]\nNick Fury: Secure office. [all the windows are blackened, Fury takes out the flash drive Natasha had downloaded all the files from the the Lemurian Star and places it in his computer] Open Lemurian Star's satellite launch file.\nSHIELD Computer: Access denied.\nNick Fury: Run decryption.\nSHIELD Computer: Decryption failed.\nNick Fury: Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.\nSHIELD Computer: Override denied. All files sealed.\nNick Fury: On whose authority?\nSHIELD Computer: Fury, Nicholas J.\n[Fury looks confused and worried]\nNick Fury: World Security Council.\nSHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\n\n\n[Alexander Pierce is holding a virtual meeting with the World Security Council]\nCouncilman Rockwell: If Nick Fury thinks he can get us costumed thugs and STRIKE commandos to mop-up his mess, he's sadly mistaken. This failure is unacceptable.\nCouncilman Singh: Well, considering this attack took place one mile from my country's sovereign waters, it's a bit more then that. I move for immediate hearing.\nCouncilwoman Hawley: We don't need hearings, we need action. It's this Council's duty to oversee SHIELD.\nCouncilman Yen: A breach like this raises serious questions.\nCouncilman Rockwell: Like how the hell did a French pirate manage to hijack a covert SHIELD vessel in broad daylight?\nAlexander Pierce: For the record, councilman, he's Algerian. I can draw a map if it'll help.\nCouncilman Rockwell: I appreciate your wits, Secretary Pierce. But this Council take things like international piracy fairly seriously.\nAlexander Pierce: Really? I don't. I don't care about one boat, I care about the fleet. If this Council is going to fold a rancor every time someone pushes us on the playing field, maybe we need someone to oversee us.\nCouncilman Yen: Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...\n[they are interrupted by Pierce's assistant walking in and whispering something to Pierce; to the council]\nAlexander Pierce: Excuse me.\nCouncilman Rockwell: More trouble, Mr. Secretary?\nAlexander Pierce: It depends on your definition.\n[the meeting ends as Pierce leaves]\nAlexander Pierce: I work forty floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?\nNick Fury: Well, a nuclear war would do it too.\n[they shake hands; referring to Pierce's meeting with the World Security Council]\nNick Fury: Busy in there?\nAlexander Pierce: Nothing some earmarks can't fix.\nNick Fury: I'm, uh...here to ask a favor. I want you to call for a vote. Project insight has to be delayed.\nAlexander Pierce: Nick, that's not a favor, that's a subcommittee hearing. A long one.\nNick Fury: It could be nothing, probably is nothing. I just need time to make sure it's nothing.\nAlexander Pierce: What if it's something?\nNick Fury: Then we'll both be damn glad those Helicarriers aren't in the air.\n[Pierce hesitates a moment before replying]\nAlexander Pierce: Fine. But you gotta get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.\n[Nick shakes his hand]\nNick Fury: Thank you, sir.\nAlexander Pierce: And not just a flyby, he's got to mingle.\n[Pierce turns and leaves]\n\n\n[Steve goes to a PTSD group meeting where Sam is counseling other veterans]\nFemale War Veteran: The thing is I think it's getting worse. A cop pulled me over last week, he thought I was drunk. I swerved to miss a plastic bag. I thought it was an IED.\nSam Wilson: Some stuff you leave there, other stuff you bring back. It's our job to figure out how to carry it. Is it gonna be in a big suitcase or in a little man-purse? It's up to you.\n[after the meeting ends Steve waits for Sam as he finishes saying goodbye to the veterans]\nFemale War Veteran: I'll see you next week.\nSam Wilson: Yeah.\nFemale War Veteran: Yeah. [Sam walks over to Steve]\nSam Wilson: Look who it is. The running man.\nSteve Rogers: Caught the last few minutes. It's pretty intense.\nSam Wilson: Yeah, brother, we all got the same problems. Guilt, regret.\nSteve Rogers: You lose someone?\nSam Wilson: My wingman, Riley. Flying a night mission.Standard PJ rescue op, nothing we hadn't done a thousand times before, till RPG knock Riley's dumb ass out of the sky. Nothing I could do. It's like I was up there just to watch.\nSteve Rogers: I'm sorry.\nSam Wilson: After that, I had really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know?\nSteve Rogers: But you're happy now, back in the world?\nSam Wilson: Hey, the number of people giving me orders is down to about zero. So, hell, yeah. You thinking about getting out?\nSteve Rogers: No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know what I would do with myself if I did.\nSam Wilson: Ultimate fighting? [Steve laughs] It's just a great idea off the top of my head. But seriously, you could do whatever you want to do. What makes you happy?\nSteve Rogers: I don't know.\n\n\n[as Fury drives through the city he instructs his car computer to make a call]\nFury's Car: Activating communications encryption protocol.\nNick Fury: Open secure line zero-four-zero-five.\nFury's Car: Confirmed.\nMaria Hill: This is Hill.\nNick Fury: I need you here in D.C. Deep shadow conditions.\nMaria Hill: Give me four hours.\nNick Fury: You have three, over. [Fury stops at a red traffic light, he looks over to the next car and sees the two police officers in the car look at him with suspicion] Want to see my lease? [the policemen quickly sound their police horn once before they start to drive off, as Fury goes to drive off suddenly another police car smashes into his car, his car is then surrounded by several other police cars crashing into him; inside his car Fury is injured]\nFury's Car: Fracture detected. Recommend anesthetic injection. [as Fury is giving himself the injection a SWAT team truck pulls up] D.C. Metro Police dispatch shows no units in this area. [Fury is surrounded by the police and SWAT team, he quickly realizes they are all disguised mercenaries; to his car computer]\nNick Fury: Get me out of here! [the mercenaries suddenly start shooting at Fury's car]\nFury's Car: Propulsion systems offline.\nNick Fury: Then reboot, dammit! [the armor on Fury's vehicle starts to become weaker, the mercenaries bring out a battering ram to break in]\nFury's Car: Warning! Window integrity compromised.\nNick Fury: You think? How long to propulsion?\nFury's Car: Calculating. [the mercenaries start to use the battering ram on Fury's car window] Window Integrity thiry-one percent. Deploying countermeasures.\nNick Fury: Hold that order! [the batterring ram is smashed against the car window again]\nFury's Car: Window Integrity nineteen percent. Offensive measures advised.\nNick Fury: Wait! [the battering ram is smashed against the window again]\nFury's Car: Window Integrity one percent.\nNick Fury: Now! [suddenly a minigun pulls up from inside the car and Fury uses it to return fire on the mercenaries causing the SWAT truck and some of the police cars to explode]\nFury's Car: Propulsion systems now online.\nNick Fury: Full acceleration, now! [as he continues to fire at the mercenaries Fury's car automatically backs up and drives off] Initiate vertical takeoff!\nFury's Car: Flight systems damaged.\nNick Fury: Then activate guidance cameras! [Fury goes over into the drivers seat] Give me the wheel! [Fury takes over driving his car as the mercenaries chase after him in their police cars] Get me Agent Hill.\nFury's Car: Communications array damaged.\nNick Fury: Well, what's not damaged?\nFury's Car: Air conditioning is fully operational. [the police cars continue to chase after Fury as he weaves through the cars on the road] Traffic ahead.\nNick Fury: Give me an alternate route.\nFury's Car: Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge. All vehicles stopped. 17th Avenue clear in three blocks, directly ahead. [as Fury heads into the traffic he smashes into some cars causing a pile up which stops the police cars, the mercenaries get out and start shooting at Fury's car, Fury manages to kill two of the mercenaries by running them down before getting past the traffic, but the remaining mercenaries continue to chase after him and manage to sandwich Fury's vehicle between them] Warning, approaching intersection. [as they approach the intersection Fury manages to shake off the two police cars, killing off the mercenaries]\nNick Fury: Get me off the grid!\nFury's Car: Calculating route to secure location. [Fury sees a mysterious figure emerge ahead which suddenly shoots a bomb that attaches itself to Fury's vehicle causing it to explode and flip over; trapped inside his car, Fury watches as the figure walks over to the car but he manages to escape just in time by using a laser weapon to burn a hole out.]\n\n\n[As Steve is walking to his apartment his hears his pretty neighbor talking on the phone as she goes to do her laundry]\nSharon Carter: That's so sweet. That is so nice. Hey. I gotta go, though. Okay, bye. [turning to Steve] My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac. [Steve smiles at her] Yeah.\nSteve Rogers: Hey, if you want...if you want, you're welcome to use my machine. Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.\nSharon Carter: Oh, yeah? What's it cost?\nSteve Rogers: A cup of coffee?\nSharon Carter: Thank you, but um...I already have a load in downstairs, and, uh...you really don't want my scrubs in your machine. I'm just finished orientation in the infectious diseases ward, so.\nSteve Rogers: Ah, well, I'll keep my distance.\nSharon Carter: Well hopefully not too far. [Steve nods and turns to go into his apartment] Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.\nSteve Rogers: Oh. Right, thank you.\nSharon Carter: Yeah. [Steve watches her go down the stairs before turning in suspicion to his door]\n\n\n[Steve hears music as he cautiously enters his apartment though the window, he grabs his shield for protection and finds Fury sitting on his couch in the dark]\nSteve Rogers: I don't remember giving you a key.\nNick Fury: You really think I'd need one? My wife kicked me out.\nSteve Rogers: Didn't know you were married.\nNick Fury: A lot of things you don't about me.\nSteve Rogers: I know, Nick. That's the problem. [as Steve turns on the light he notices Fury's injuries for the first time, but Fury indicates for him to be silent, he turns off the light and writes something on his phone and shows it to Steve; \"ears everywhere\"]\nNick Fury: I'm sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash. [he writes another text and shows it to Steve; \"SHIELD compromised\"]\nSteve Rogers: Who else knows about your wife? [Fury shows him another text; \"You and me\"]\nNick Fury: Just...my friends.\nSteve Rogers: Is that what we are?\nNick Fury: That's up to you. [suddenly Fury is shot three times from through the wall and collapses, Steve looks out the window for the shooter then he quickly drags Fury to the next room, before he leaves Fury hands him the flash drive] Don't...trust anyone. [Fury passes out] [Steve hears someone breaking into his apartment and hears his neighbor calling out to him]\nSharon Carter: Captain Rogers? [Steve sees her walking in with her gun pointed] Captain, I'm Agent 13 of SHIELD Special Service.\nSteve Rogers: Kate?\nSharon Carter: I'm assigned to protect you.\nSteve Rogers: On whose order? [She notices Fury lying injured on the ground]\nSharon Carter: His. [she goes to Fury then contacts SHIELD through her radio] Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive. I need EMTs.\nSHIELD Agent: Do you have a twenty on the shooter? [Steve notices the shooter though the window]\nSteve Rogers: Tell him I'm in pursuit. [Steve smashes through his window and runs after the assassin, who is the same mysterious man that had exploded Fury's car, Steve chases him through an office building smashing through the walls, when he finally catches up with him on the roof he throws his shield at the assassin, but he catches it with one swift move, then throws it back to Steve and then jumps down the building and disappears.]\n\n\n[Natasha goes to the hospital and meets up with Steve, they watch doctors operating on Fury]\nNatasha Romanoff: Is he gonna make it?\nSteve Rogers: I don't know.\nNatasha Romanoff: Tell me about the shooter.\nSteve Rogers: He's fast and strong. Had a metal arm. [just then Agent Maria Hill also joins them]\nNatasha Romanoff: Ballistics?\nMaria Hill: Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable.\nNatasha Romanoff: Soviet-made.\nMaria Hill: Yeah. [suddenly they watch in shock as Fury's state deteriorates]\nMale Nurse: He's in V-tach.\nFemale Nurse: Crash cart coming in.\nDoctor: Nurse, help me with the drape.\nMale Nurse: BP is dropping.\nDoctor: Defibrillator! [Steve, Natasha and Hill watch in shock as Fury is flatlining] I want you to charge him at one hundred.\nNatasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick.\nDoctor: Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given a shock with the defibrillator] Pulse?\nMale Nurse: No pulse.\nDoctor #1: No pulse.\nDoctor: Okay. 200, please. Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given another shock] Give me epinephrine! Pulse?\nMale Nurse: Negative.\nNatasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick. Don't do this to me. [the three watch the doctors as they continue to revive Fury but Fury is still showing as flatlining, Steve turns away as they finally call his time of death]\nDoctor: What's the time?\nFemale Nurse: 1:03, Doctor.\nDoctor: Time of death, 1:03 a.m. [Steve looks down at the flash drive Fury had given him]\n\n\n[Natasha and Steve are in a room where Fury's dead body has been laid out, Natasha is looking at Fury's body with tears running down her face, Hill joins them]\nMaria Hill: I need to take him. [Steve goes over to Natasha]\nSteve Rogers: Natasha. [she doesn't respond, instead she tenderly touches Fury's head then turns and walks out, Steve follows her] Natasha!\nNatasha Romanoff: Why was Fury in your apartment?\nSteve Rogers: I don't know. [they are interrupted by Rumlow]\nBrock Rumlow: Cap, they want you back at SHIELD.\nSteve Rogers: Yeah, give me a second.\nBrock Rumlow: They want you now.\nSteve Rogers: Okay. [Steven turns to Natasha]\nNatasha Romanoff: You're a terrible liar. [she turns and walks off]\nJasper Sitwell: [on earpiece] STRIKE team, escort Captain Rogers back to SHIELD immediately for questioning.\nBrock Rumlow: I told him. [Steve notices the vending machine next to him, we then see Steve walking towards Rumlow]\nSteve Rogers: Let's go.\nBrock Rumlow: Yeah. [to the agents] STRIKE, move it out. [as they leave we see that Steve has hid the flash drive behind a pack of gums in the vending machine]\n\n\n[back at SHIELD, Steve is brought to Pierce who is talking to Agent 13]\nAlexander Pierce: For whatever it's worth, you did your best.\nSharon Carter: Thank you, sir. [as she turns to leave she sees Steve] Captain Rogers. [Steve replies coldly as he walks towards Pierce]\nSteve Rogers: Neighbor.\nAlexander Pierce: Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.\nSteve Rogers: Sir, it's an honor. [they shake hands]\nAlexander Pierce: The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in. [they enter Pierce's office where he shows Steve an old photo of Fury with Pierce] That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, \"No, we'll negotiate.\" Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.\nSteve Rogers: So you gave him a promotion.\nAlexander Pierce: I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?\nSteve Rogers: I don't know.\nAlexander Pierce: You know it was bugged?\nSteve Rogers: I did, because Nick told me.\nAlexander Pierce: Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it? [Steve doesn't reply obviously not knowing this information] I want you to see something. [he brings up footage of Batroc being interrogated]\nSHIELD Agent: Who hired you, Batroc?\nSteve Rogers: Is that live?\nAlexander Pierce: Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.\nSteve Rogers: Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.\nAlexander Pierce: No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.\nSteve Rogers: Am I supposed to know who that is? [he hands Steve the file]\nAlexander Pierce: Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.\nSteve Rogers: Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?\nAlexander Pierce: The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.\nSteve Rogers: If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.\nAlexander Pierce: Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry. [he hesitates a moment] Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?\nSteve Rogers: He told me not to trust anyone.\nAlexander Pierce: I wonder if that included him. [Steve pauses a moment before replying]\nSteve Rogers: I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me. [Steve picks up his shield, places it on his back and starts to make his out of the office]\nAlexander Pierce: Captain. [Steve stops and looks at Pierce] Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.\nSteve Rogers: Understood. [Steve turns and leaves]\n\n\nSteve Rogers: [after he leaves Pierce's office he steps into the elevator] Operations control.\nSHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [just as the elevator doors are about to close Rumlow steps in with two STRIKE agents]\nBrock Rumlow: Keep all STRIKE personnel on site.\nSTRIKE Agent #1: Understood.\nSTRIKE Agent #2: Yes, sir.\nBrock Rumlow: Forensics.\nSHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\nBrock Rumlow: Cap.\nSteve Rogers: Rumlow. [the elevator doors close and they start riding down]\nBrock Rumlow: Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac-team ready?\nSteve Rogers: No, lets wait and see what it is first.\nBrock Rumlow: Right. [Steve notices one of the agents touching his weapon suspiciously] [the elevator stops and more SHIELD and STRIKE agents enter]\nSHIELD Agent #1: What's the status so far?\nSHIELD Agent #2: Administrations level.\nSHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\nSHIELD Agent #2: [to Steve] Excuse me.\nBrock Rumlow: [to Steve] I'm sorry about what happened with Fury. Messed up, what happened to him.\nSteve Rogers: Thank you. [feeling something is off, Steve looks at the agents in the elevator and notices one of them is sweating, then the elevator stops and more agents enter]\nSTRIKE Agent #3: Records.\nSHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [as the elevator doors close Steve realizes he's been surrounded by agents]\nSteve Rogers: Before we get started, does anyone want to get out? [there's a moment's pause before suddenly one of the agents turns and uses an electric rod to give Steve a shock, the others grab him and try to strap his wrists with magnetic cuffs, Steve manages to knock some of them down but one cuff remains, then Rumlow uses his rod to give Steve a shock] [as Steve is being attacked we see Sitwell in a controls room watching them from a monitor]\nJasper Sitwell: Mobilize STRIKE units, 25th floor. [Steve manages free himself from the magnetic cuff and knock all the agents down, he turns to Rumlow]\nBrock Rumlow: Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal. [Rumlow then goes to attack Steve with his electric rod but Steve manages to defend himself and eventually knocks Rumlow out]\nSteve Rogers: It kind of feels personal. [Steve picks up his shield then opens the elevator doors, but he's faced by a team of STRIKE agents pointing their weapons at him]\n25th Floor STRIKE Agent: Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air! [Steve uses his shield to break off the elevator wires which sends the elevator down, as he forces the doors open he sees more STRIKE agents approaching him, he closes the door and looks for a way out]\nSTRIKE Agent: Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go! [Steve breaks through the glass in the elevator and plummets down to finally hit the ground floor, from his monitor Sitwell watches in shock as Steve gets up and starts running off]\nJasper Sitwell: Are you kidding me? [ordering the STRIKE team] He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge! [Steve rides out of the SHIELD garage on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out but then a Quinjet emerges ahead of him]\nQuinjet Pilot: Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down. [the Quinjet lowers its machine gun] Repeat, stand down. [as Steve doesn't stop they start shooting at him, Steve throws his shield into the propellers to jam it, giving him an opportunity to hop onto it and do more damage to the jet with his shield before jumping off as the jet goes crashing down and he escapes]\n\n\nJasper Sitwell: [to the SHIELD agents] Eyes here. [everyone, including Agent 13, looks at Sitwell] Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor, right here. Scan all open sources. Phones, computers, PDAs, whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.\nSharon Carter: With all due respect, If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.\nAlexander Pierce: Because he lied to us. [Pierce enters the room] Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.\n\n\n[disguised as a civilian dressed in a hoody, Steve goes back to the hospital to retrieve the flash drive from the vending machine but sees it's gone, then Natasha appears behind him chewing some gum, in anger Steve pushes her into a room]\nSteve Rogers: Where is it?\nNatasha Romanoff: Safe.\nSteve Rogers: Do better!\nNatasha Romanoff: Where did you get it?\nSteve Rogers: Why would I tell you?\nNatasha Romanoff: Fury gave it to you. Why?\nSteve Rogers: What's on it?\nNatasha Romanoff: I don't know.\nSteve Rogers: Stop lying!\nNatasha Romanoff: I only act like I know everything, Rogers.\nSteve Rogers: I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?\nNatasha Romanoff: Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.\nSteve Rogers: I'm not gonna ask you again.\nNatasha Romanoff: I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.\nSteve Rogers: So he's a ghost story.\nNatasha Romanoff: Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me. [she pulls up her shirt to show him the scar on the side of her stomach] Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.\nSteve Rogers: Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now. [there's a hit of a smile from Natasha]\nNatasha Romanoff: Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried. [Natasha holds up the flash drive] Like you said, he's a ghost story. [Steve takes the flash drive from her]\nSteve Rogers: Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.\n\n\n[Pierce is holding another virtual meeting with the World Security Council]\nAlexander Pierce: Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.\nCouncilman Rockwell: You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.\nCouncilman Singh: Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst...\nAlexander Pierce: Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and paper right here.\nCouncilwoman Hawley: That discussion can be tabled for a later time.\nAlexander Pierce: But you do want to have a discussion.\nCouncilman Rockwell: We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.\n\n\n[Steve and Natasha go to the mall disguised as a civilian couple]\nNatasha Romanoff: First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.\nSteve Rogers: If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off. [they go to a Mac store to use one of their computers]\nNatasha Romanoff: The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are.\nSteve Rogers: How much time do we have?\nNatasha Romanoff: Uh...about nine minutes from... [she pops the flash drive into a MacBook Pro] Now. [we see several SHIELD vehicles heading their way] Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.\nSteve Rogers: Can you override it?\nNatasha Romanoff: The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly. [Rumlow and his team pull up outside the mall and head inside] [back at the Mac store, Steve and Natasha continue to try and find out what's on the flash drive] I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.\nApple Employee: Can I help you guys with anything?\nNatasha Romanoff: Oh, no. My fianc\u00e9 was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.\nSteve Rogers: Right! We're getting married.\nApple Employee: Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going? [Steve looks at the monitor and sees the signal traced to somewhere in New Jersey]\nSteve Rogers: New Jersey.\nApple Employee: Oh. [the employee looks at Steve for a moment] I have the exact same glasses.\nNatasha Romanoff: Wow, you two are practically twins.\nApple Employee: Yeah, I wish. Specimen. Uh...if you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.\nSteve Rogers: Thank you. [as Rumlow and his team are in the mall looking for Steve and Natasha] You said nine minutes, come on.\nNatasha Romanoff: Shh, relax. Got it. [they find the signal is coming from Wheaton, NJ] You know it?\nSteve Rogers: I used to. Let's go. [Steve pulls the flash drive from the computer and they walk out of the store] Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro. [as two agents are coming straight towards them]\nNatasha Romanoff: Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.\nSteve Rogers: What?\nNatasha Romanoff: Do it! [Steve quickly puts his arm around Natasha and laughs] [inside the Mac store one of the agents looks around]\nJack Rollins: Negative at the source.\nBrock Rumlow: Give me a floor rundown.\nSHIELD Agent #2: Negative on three.\nSHIELD Agent #3: Negative on two.\nBrock Rumlow: Snake the upper levels, work down to me. [as they are going down the escalator Natasha spots Rumlow on the escalator next to them going up, she turns to Steve]\nNatasha Romanoff: Kiss me.\nSteve Rogers: What?\nNatasha Romanoff: Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.\nSteve Rogers: Yes, they do. [she quickly pulls down Steve's head and kisses him making Rumlow look away as he goes past them on the escalator]\nNatasha Romanoff: You still uncomfortable?\nSteve Rogers: It's not exactly the word I would use.\n\n\n[as they drive to New Jersey]\nNatasha Romanoff: Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?\nSteve Rogers: Nazi Germany.\nNatasha Romanoff: Mm.\nSteve Rogers: And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash. [Natasha takes her feet off the dash]\nNatasha Romanoff: Alright, I have a question for you, oh, which you do not have to answer. I feel like if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know?\nSteve Rogers: What?\nNatasha Romanoff: Was that your first kiss since 1945?\nSteve Rogers: That bad, huh?\nNatasha Romanoff: I didn't say that.\nSteve Rogers: Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.\nNatasha Romanoff: No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you've had.\nSteve Rogers: You don't need practice.\nNatasha Romanoff: Everybody needs practice.\nSteve Rogers: It was not my first kiss since 1945. I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.\nNatasha Romanoff: Nobody special, though? [Steve chuckles]\nSteve Rogers: Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.\nNatasha Romanoff: Well, that's alright, you just make something up.\nSteve Rogers: What, like you?\nNatasha Romanoff: I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances, it's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I.\nSteve Rogers: That's a tough way to live.\nNatasha Romanoff: It's a good way not to die, though.\nSteve Rogers: You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone when you don't know who that someone really is.\nNatasha Romanoff: Yeah. Who do you want me to be?\nSteve Rogers: How about a friend? [Natasha laughs softly]\nNatasha Romanoff: Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.\n\n\n[the two pull up to outside an abandoned military base where the signal led them to]\nSteve Rogers: This is it.\nNatasha Romanoff: The file came from these coordinates.\nSteve Rogers: So did I. [later that night as they walk around the base trying to pinpoint where the signal came from] This camp is where I was trained.\nNatasha Romanoff: Changed much?\nSteve Rogers: A little. [Steve has a brief visions of his former, smaller self running past him as he's getting trained with other soldiers]\nSergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Double time! Come on Rogers, move it! [his former self stops and stares at Steve as he is now] Come on! Fall in! Rogers! I said fall in! [present Steve watches nostalgically as the former Steve runs off]\nNatasha Romanoff: This is a dead end. Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off. [Steve notices a building ahead of them] What is it? [as they walk over to the building]\nSteve Rogers: Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place. [Steve opens the lock with his shield and they enter inside, when they turn on the lights they notice it's a SHIELD office]\nNatasha Romanoff: This is SHIELD.\nSteve Rogers: Maybe where it started. [they enter a room where they find old framed portraits of Howard Stark, Peggy and Col. Chester Phillips]\nNatasha Romanoff: There's Stark's father.\nSteve Rogers: Howard.\nNatasha Romanoff: Who's the girl? [Steve doesn't reply and turns away to walk further down the room and stops by a massive book shelf]\nSteve Rogers: If you're already working in a secret office... [he pushes the books shelf and slides open to reveal an elevator behind it] Why do you need to hide the elevator? [they go down the elevator which takes them to a room with old looking computers]\nNatasha Romanoff: This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient. [suddenly Natasha notices a small flash drive port, she places the flash drive in it which then activates the ancient computer in the room]\nComputer: Initiate system? [Natasha types using the keyboard]\nNatasha Romanoff: Y-E-S, spells yes. [Natasha smiles as the old computer starts to cranks up] \"Shall we play a game?\" [to Steve] It's from a movie that...\nSteve Rogers: Yeah, I saw it. [suddenly they hear an accented voice speaking]\nDr. Arnim Zola: Rogers, Steven. Born, 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna. Born, 1984. [they see an old camera moving above them as it analyzes them]\nNatasha Romanoff: It's some kind of a recording.\nDr. Arnim Zola: I am not a recording, Fr\u00e4ulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945, but I am. [the computer screen shows an old photo of Dr. Arnim Zola]\nNatasha Romanoff: Do you know this thing?\nSteve Rogers: Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He's been dead for years.\nDr. Arnim Zola: First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.\nSteve Rogers: How did you get here?\nDr. Arnim Zola: Invited.\nNatasha Romanoff: It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value.\nDr. Arnim Zola: They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.\nSteve Rogers: HYDRA died with the Red Skull.\nDr. Arnim Zola: Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.\nSteve Rogers: Prove it.\nDr. Arnim Zola: Accessing archive. [the computer screen shows them old footage of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, of the how the original SHIELD founders] HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.\nNatasha Romanoff: That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.\nDr. Arnim Zola: Accidents will happen. [the computer screen shows them HYDRA had killed Howard and Maria Stark making it look like a car accident along with the recent death of Fury] HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum. [in anger Steve suddenly smashes the computer screen] As I was saying...\nSteve Rogers: What's on this drive?\nDr. Arnim Zola: Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.\nNatasha Romanoff: What kind of algorithm? What does it do?\nDr. Arnim Zola: The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it. [suddenly the doors starts to close, Steve tries stops it by throwing his shield in between it but he's too late]\nNatasha Romanoff: Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.\nSteve Rogers: Who fired it?\nNatasha Romanoff: S.H.I.E.L.D.\nDr. Arnim Zola: I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time. [Steve notices a small opening on the ground, he throws the metal door aside and just as the place explodes he throws himself and Natasha into the hole and protects them with his shield, he then manages to get them out from under the building rubble just as STRIKE agents arrive to roam the area for them]\nBrock Rumlow: [As he notices a footprint in the dust] Call in the asset.\n\n\n[at his home, Pierce goes to his kitchen to get a drink when he sees the Winter Soldier sat behind behind him with his gun on the table when his housekeeper calls out]\nRenata: I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave?\nAlexander Pierce: No. Uh...it's fine, Renata, you can go home.\nRenata: Okay, night-night.\nAlexander Pierce: Good night. [Renata leaves] Want some milk? [the Winter Soldier doesn't reply] The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six. [he pours himself a glass of milk and goes over to join the Winter Soldier at the table] They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours. [just then Renata interrupts them as she enters the kitchen]\nRenata: Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...I forgot my phone. [she notices the Winter Soldier]\nAlexander Pierce: Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked. [Pierce picks up the gun from the table and shoots and kills her]\n\n\n[returning home from his morning run Sam hears a knock at his door, he opens the door to see Steve and Natasha]\nSam Wilson: Hey, man.\nSteve Rogers: I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.\nNatasha Romanoff: Everyone we know is trying to kill us. [Sam pauses a moment before replying]\nSam Wilson: Not everyone. [Sam let's them enter, later as Steve and Natasha are cleaning up, Steve notices Natasha looking sad and thoughtful]\nSteve Rogers: You okay?\nNatasha Romanoff: Yeah.\nSteve Rogers: What's going on?\nNatasha Romanoff: When I first joined SHIELD, I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.\nSteve Rogers: There's a chance you might be in the wrong business. [Natasha smiles faintly]\nNatasha Romanoff: I owe you.\nSteve Rogers: It's okay.\nNatasha Romanoff: If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, and you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it?\nSteve Rogers: I would now. And I'm always honest.\nNatasha Romanoff: Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.\nSteve Rogers: Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.\nSam Wilson: [to Steve and Natasha] I made breakfast. If you guys...eat that sort of thing. [later as they are sat in Sam's kitchen]\nNatasha Romanoff: So, the question is: who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike?\nSteve Rogers: Pierce.\nNatasha Romanoff: Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.\nSteve Rogers: But he's not working alone, Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.\nNatasha Romanoff: So was Jasper Sitwell.\nSteve Rogers: So, the real question is: how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?\nSam Wilson: The answer is: you don't. [Sam drops a file in front of Steve]\nSteve Rogers: What's this?\nSam Wilson: Call it a resume. [Natasha picks up a photo of Sam with his para-rescue team]\nNatasha Romanoff: Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you. [to Steve] You didn't say he was a para-rescue. [looking at the photo of Sam with his colleague]\nSteve Rogers: Is this Riley?\nSam Wilson: Yeah.\nNatasha Romanoff: I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use, a stealth chute?\nSam Wilson: No. These. [he hands Steve the file, Steve opens it and reads it]\nSteve Rogers: I thought you said you were a pilot.\nSam Wilson: I never said pilot.\nSteve Rogers: I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.\nSam Wilson: Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.\nSteve Rogers: Where can we get our hands on one of these things?\nSam Wilson: The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall. [Steve looks at Natasha who shrugs her shoulders]\nSteve Rogers: Shouldn't be a problem. [Steve throws down the file on the table and we see that it's a classified military project called Falcon]\n\n\n[after their meeting is over Sitwell walks out of the building with Senator Stern]\nSenator Stern: Listen, I gotta fly home tonight, cause uh...I got some constituency problem, and I gotta press the flesh.\nJasper Sitwell: Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?\nSenator Stern: Uh...no, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot. You know, wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know, who listens at that point?\nJasper Sitwell: Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.\nSenator Stern: Really? Cause she's killing my back. Look, this isn't the place to talk about it. [he touches Sitwell's pin on his jacket] This is a nice pin.\nJasper Sitwell: Thank you.\nSenator Stern: Come here. [they embrace and as they do Stern whispers to Sitwell] Hail, HYDRA. [as Stern steps away he touches his back] See, it's right there...\nJasper Sitwell: I just saw that, yeah.\nSenator Stern: Should I get it checked?\nJasper Sitwell: I think you should. [Stern walks away] [Sitwell gets a call from Pierce, Sitwell turns to his men] I need a minute. Bring the car around. [his men leave and Sitwell answers the phone] Yes, sir?\nSam Wilson: Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.\nJasper Sitwell: Who is this?\nSam Wilson: The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock. [Sitwell looks around but doesn't see him] Your other ten o'clock. [Sitwell turns the other way and sees Sam sitting a few feet away from him] There you go.\nJasper Sitwell: What do you want?\nSam Wilson: You're gonna go around the corner, to your right. There's a grey car, two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.\nJasper Sitwell: And why would I do that?\nSam Wilson: Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up. [Sitwell looks down at his tie and sees a small red light from the gun being pointed at him] [Steve throws Sitwell across a rooftop, Natasha follows behind him]\nSteve Rogers: Tell me about Zola's algorithm.\nJasper Sitwell: Never heard of it.\nSteve Rogers: What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?\nJasper Sitwell: I was throwing up, I get seasick. [Steve forces Sitwell to the edge of the rooftop, Sitwell just smiles] Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.\nSteve Rogers: You're right. It's not. It's hers. [Steve steps aside and Natasha kicks Sitwell off the roof, he plummets down screaming]\nNatasha Romanoff: Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting, Laura...?\nSteve Rogers: Lillian. Lip piercing, right?\nNatasha Romanoff: Yeah, she's cute.\nSteve Rogers: Yeah, I'm not ready for that. [suddenly, Sam, in his Falcon jet-pack suit with wings, flies up holding Sitwell and throws him down on the roof] [Steve and Natasha walk towards Sitwell, he holds his hand up in fear]\nJasper Sitwell: Zola's algorithm is a program...for choosing Insight's targets!\nSteve Rogers: What targets?\nJasper Sitwell: You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Undersecretary of Defense, a high school valedictorian in Iowa city. Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA! Now, or in the future.\nSteve Rogers: The Future? How could it know? [Sitwell laughs]\nJasper Sitwell: How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. [Steve and Natasha look at him in confusion] Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores. Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.\nSteve Rogers: And what then?\nJasper Sitwell: Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.\nSteve Rogers: What then?!\nJasper Sitwell: Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time.\n\n\nJasper Sitwell: [as Sam drives them to Triskelion] HYDRA doesn't like leaks.\nSam Wilson: So why don't you try sticking a cork in it.\nNatasha Romanoff: Insight's launching in sixteen hours, we're cutting it a little bit close here.\nSteve Rogers: I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the Helicarriers directly.\nJasper Sitwell: What?! Are you crazy? That is a terrible, terrible idea. [suddenly the Winter Soldier lands on the car roof, pulls Sitwell out through the window and throws him into the oncoming traffic, killing him, he then starts shooting at them until Steve pulls the break handle making the Winter Soldier drop down onto the street, as another car smashes into the trio's car and pushes them along, the Winter Soldier jumps back onto their car, smashes through the windscreen and pulls out the steering wheel]\nSam Wilson: Shit! [Natasha starts shooting at him but the Winter Soldier jumps onto the vehicle behind them, as the trio's car is being pulled off the road Steve holds on to the car door]\nSteve Rogers: Hang on! [he breaks open the door, holding onto Natasha and Sam, they slide on the car door through the streets] [the Winter Soldier is joined by HYDRA agents and they start shooting at them, the trio scatter and run off in different directions with the Winter Soldier shooting at Natasha but she manages to shoot him in his eye goggle mask and run off]\nWinter Soldier: \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f. \u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e. (She's mine. ([subtitled as:] I'll take care of her.) Find him.) [the Winter Soldier goes in pursuit of Natasha as the Hydra agents go after Steve and Sam who both manage to fend them off as they shoot at them, Steve then notices the Winter Soldier in pursuit of Natasha]\nSam Wilson: Go, I got this! [the Winter Soldier thinks he's found Natasha hiding behind a car as he can hear her voice]\nNatasha Romanoff: I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block of Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened. [he rolls a bomb towards where he thinks she's hiding. As the bomb rolls behind the car we see that Natasha isn't actually there but a recording over her voice is being played back on a phone] I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. [as the bomb explodes Natasha jumps onto the Winter Soldiers back and tries to kill him but he throws her off, she starts running off as he goes after her]\nNatasha Romanoff: [to the civilians as she tries to get away from the Winter Soldier] Get out of the way! Stay out of the way! [suddenly she gets shot in the shoulder, she falls and looks around her, as the Winter Soldier comes up from behind to shoot her Steve jumps in and attacks him, they fight and in the process the Winter Soldier takes Steve's shield and throws it at him but Steve manages to avoid being hit, after battling it out more the Winter Soldier's mask comes off, as he looks around at Steve we learn the true identity of the Winter Soldier; Bucky Barnes]\nSteve Rogers: Bucky?\nBucky Barnes: Who the hell is Bucky? [as Bucky goes to shoot at Steve Sam flies in and kicks Bucky aside, Bucky takes aim again but before he can shoot Natasha uses the grenade launcher Bucky dropped earlier to shoot at Bucky who vanishes in the smoke of the explosion, then the trio hear sirens after which they are surrounded by HYDRA agents being led by Rumlow]\nBrock Rumlow: Drop the shield, Cap! On your knees! Get on your knees! Now! Get down! Get down! [Steve holds his hands up] Get on your knees! Down! [he kicks Steve's leg and Steve kneels down] Don't move. [Rumlow looks at the helicopter flying above them and warns Rollins who's holding Steve at gunpoint] Put the gun down. Not here. Not here! [Rollins lowers his gun, the HYDRA agents then take Steve, Sam, and Natasha into custody]\n\n\n[as the trio is being escorted in a van]\nSteve Rogers: It was him. He looked right at me like he didn't even know me.\nSam Wilson: How's that even possible? It was like seventy years ago.\nSteve Rogers: Zola. Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43, Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and...\nNatasha Romanoff: None of that's your fault, Steve.\nSteve Rogers: Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky. [Sam notices Natasha is bleeding from her shoulder and looks at the guards]\nSam Wilson: We need to get a doctor here. We don't put pressure on that wound she's gonna bleed out here in the truck. [suddenly one of the guards pulls out an electric rod and neutralizes the other guard and knocks him out, the guard is revealed to be Hill as she takes off her helmet]\nMaria Hill: Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain. [Sam looks at her in confusion; to Steve] Who's this guy? [Rumlow's crew stop their vehicles and get out]\nBrock Rumlow: Three holes. Start digging. [they go over to the van holding Steve, Sam and Natasha and as they open the door they find it empty with one of the guards left unconscious and massive burnt whole on the car floor]\n\n\n[Hill has taken the trio to a secret facility, a man runs towards them; referring to Natasha's wound]\nMaria Hill: GSW. She's lost at least a pint.\nSam Wilson: Maybe two.\nDoctor: Let me take her.\nMaria Hill: She'll want to see him first. [Hill takes them to Fury who's alive and lying in bed, the trio look at him in shock]\nNick Fury: About damn time. [later as Natasha's wound is being treated] Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, one hell of a headache.\nDoctor: Don't forget your collapsed lung.\nNick Fury: Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.\nNatasha Romanoff: They cut you open, your heart stopped.\nNick Fury: Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute. Banner developed it for stress. Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.\nSteve Rogers: Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?\nMaria Hill: Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.\nNick Fury: Can't kill you if you're already dead. Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.\n\n\n[inside a bank vault, the HYDRA agents fix Bucky's metal arm and as they do so he has a brief flashback to his old life after he was recovered by Zola and the HYDRA agents]\nDr. Arnim Zola: Sergeant Barnes... [he has to flashback to falling off the train at the edge of the mountain with Steve trying to save him]\nSteve Rogers: Bucky, no! [he then has flashback to after he's picked up by Hydra agents]\nDr. Arnim Zola: The procedure has already started. [we see the Zola and the Hydra agent amputating his left arm and replacing with the metal arm] You are to be the new fist of HYDRA. [to his men] Put him on ice. [we see Bucky being frozen after which he comes back to the present and knocks over the HYDRA agent fixing his arm, Rollins points his gun at him to stop him attacking any further] [as Pierce enters the bank vault Bucky is being held in]\nScientist #1: Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic. [Pierce enters with Rumlow and some other HYDRA agents and goes over to Bucky]\nAlexander Pierce: Mission report. [Bucky; looking blank, doesn't respond] Mission report, now. [Pierce moves closer to Bucky and suddenly strikes him hard in the face]\nBucky Barnes: The man on the bridge... [he has flashback to Steve calling him by his name] Who was he?\nAlexander Pierce: You met him earlier this week on another assignment.\nBucky Barnes: I knew him. [Pierce sits in front of Bucky]\nAlexander Pierce: Your work has been a gift to mankind. You shaped the century, and I need you to do it one more time. Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos. Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push. But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine, and HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.\nBucky Barnes: But I knew him. [Pierce turns to the scientists]\nAlexander Pierce: Prep him.\nScientist #1: He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.\nAlexander Pierce: Then wipe him and start over. [the scientists strap Bucky in his chair and then place a teeth shield in his mouth as they begin the process of wiping his brain with Bucky screaming in pain]\n\n\n[back at the secret facility]\nNick Fury: [looking at a photo of Pierce] This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize. He said, \"Peace wasn't an achievement, it was a responsibility.\" See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.\nNatasha Romanoff: We have to stop the launch.\nNick Fury: I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore. [Fury opens a case containing three chips]\nSam Wilson: What's that?\nMaria Hill: Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet, they'll triangulate with Insight satellites becoming fully weaponized.\nNick Fury: We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own.\nMaria Hill: One or two won't cut it. We need to link all three carriers for this to work, because if even one of those ships remains operational a whole lot of people are gonna die.\nNick Fury: We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA. We need to get pass them, insert the server blades, and maybe, just maybe, we can salvage what's left...\nSteve Rogers: We're not salvaging anything. We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick, we're taking down SHIELD.\nNick Fury: SHIELD had nothing to do with it.\nSteve Rogers: You gave me this mission, this is how it ends. SHIELD's been compromised, you said so yourself. HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed.\nNick Fury: Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed.\nSteve Rogers: And how many paid the price before you did?\nNick Fury: Look, I didn't know about Barnes.\nSteve Rogers: Even if you have, would you have told me? Or would you have compartmentalized that too? SHIELD, HYDRA, it all goes.\nMaria Hill: He's right. [Fury looks at Natasha then Sam]\nSam Wilson: Don't look at me. I do what he does, just slower.\nNick Fury: Well... Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.\n\n\n[Steve stands on a bridge and has a flashback to the time he spent with Bucky after Steve's mother's funeral]\nBucky Barnes: We looked for you after. My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery. [they walk towards Steve's apartment]\nSteve Rogers: I know, I'm sorry. I just...kind of wanted to be alone.\nBucky Barnes: How was it?\nSteve Rogers: It was okay. She's next to Dad.\nBucky Barnes: I was gonna ask...\nSteve Rogers: I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...\nBucky Barnes: We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids. It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash. [as they get to the apartment door, Steve tries to find his keys, Bucky kicks a brick aside, picks up the apartment keys from under it and gives it to Steve] Come on.\nSteve Rogers: Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.\nBucky Barnes: The thing is, you don't have to. [Bucky gives Steve a friendly pat on the shoulder] I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.\n\n\n[Steve's thoughts of Bucky are interrupted as Sam joins him on the bridge]\nSam Wilson: He's gonna be there, you know?\nSteve Rogers: I know.\nSam Wilson: Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now, I don't think he's the kind you save. He's the kind you stop.\nSteve Rogers: I don't know if I can do that.\nSam Wilson: Well, he might not give you a choice. He doesn't know you.\nSteve Rogers: He will. Gear up, it's time. [Steve turns and starts to walk off]\nSam Wilson: You gonna wear that?\nSteve Rogers: No. If you're gonna fight a war, you gotta wear a uniform. [later as a guard walks in the Smithsonian Museum when he looks over to the Captain America exhibit he notices the Captain America WWII uniform on that was on the dummy has been stolen]\nSmithsonian Guard: Oh, man. I am so fired!\n\n\n[at the Triskelion where the Helicarriers are being held]\nMan on PA: We are in final launch sequence.\nSHIELD Tech: We are go on guidance.\nWoman on PA: All personnel to launch station.\n[Pierce meets the World Security Council as they arrive at the Triskelion]\nAlexander Pierce: And how was your flight?\nCouncilman Hawley: Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.\nAlexander Pierce: Sadly, SHIELD can't control everything.\nCouncilman Rockwell: Including Captain America. [Pierce walks over to one of the guards who hands him a case containing four pins]\nAlexander Pierce: This facility is biometrically controlled, and these will give you unrestricted access. [the council members each take a pin to wear]\n[at the Project Insight headquarters]\nCom Tech #1: I've been parking there for two months.\nCom Tech #2: But it's his spot.\nCom Tech #1: So where's he been?\nCom Tech #2: I think Afghanistan.\nCom Tech #1: [into his earpiece] Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full. [to his colleague] Well, he could have said something. [suddenly they hear a sharp noise through their earpiece] Ow!\nCom Tech #2: Must be the dish.\nCom Tech #1: I'll check it out.\nMan on PA: Triskelion command request we clear the area for launch.\n[as the Tech goes and opens the door he's faced with Steve, Sam and Hill on the other side of the door, Sam and Hill point their guns at him]\nSteve Rogers: Excuse us. [the tech holds his hands up and steps aside to let them enter]\nAlexander Pierce: [addressing the World Security Council members] I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth, and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful. [as they start drinking to Pierce's toast suddenly they hear Steve over the SHIELD microphone that everyone in the building can hear]\nSteve Rogers: Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not. [as Steve finishes his speech]\nSam Wilson: Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head? [to Pierce after learning the truth about him]\nCouncilman Rockwell: You smug son of a bitch.\nCouncilman Singh: [to the two HYDRA agents enter the room, thinking they are SHIELD agents] Arrest him. [the HYDRA agent points his gun at Singh]\nAlexander Pierce: I guess I've got the floor.\n[Rumlow and his men break into the control room, where Agent 13 also is, Rumlow walks over to one of the techs]\nBrock Rumlow: Preempt the launch sequence. Send those ships up now. [The tech hesitates visibly.] Is there a problem?\nSHIELD Tech: I'm... [the tech shakes his head nervously]\nBrock Rumlow: Is there a problem?\nSHIELD Tech: I'm sorry, sir. [the tech takes a few nervous breaths before replying] I'm not gonna launch those ships. Captain's orders. [Rumlow points his gun at the tech's head]\nBrock Rumlow: Move away from your station. [Agent 13 walks over to Rumlow pointing her gun at him]\nSharon Carter: Like he said! [suddenly all the SHIELD agents draw their weapons and point them at Rumlow] Captain's orders.\nBrock Rumlow: You picked the wrong side, Agent.\nSharon Carter: Depends on where you're standing. [Rumlow drops his gun, but as he does he grabs his knife and cuts Agent 13's arm, leading to the SHIELD agents firing their guns, amidst the bullets, Rumlow manages to release the Helicarriers and runs off]\n[as the bay doors holding the Helicarriers are about to be opened]\nSHIELD Agent: Close the bay door! Close the bay door now! Close the bay door! [the HYDRA agents enter and start shooting and killing the crew and techs; at the headquarters Hill watches on the monitor as the Helicarriers are being initiated]\nMaria Hill: They're initiating launch.\n\n\n[Steve and Sam make their way to the Helicarriers]\nSam Wilson: Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?\nSteve Rogers: If they're shooting at you, they're bad. [Sam, in his Falcon suit, flies off and Steve heads down, the HYDRA agents starting shooting at them, Sam flies around avoiding getting shot]\nSam Wilson: Hey, Cap, I found those bad guys you were talking about.\nSteve Rogers: You okay?\nSam Wilson: [flying off as the HYDRA agents continue to shoot at him] I'm not dead yet.\n[Pierce watches from the window the commotion caused by Steve and Sam trying to stop the Helicarriers launching, he turns to Singh]\nAlexander Pierce: Let me ask you a question. What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow, and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution? [Pierce hands Singh a glass of champagne] And you could just stop it with a flick of the switch. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you all?\nCouncilman Singh: Not if it was your switch. [Singh tosses the glass aside, one of the HYDRA agents hands Pierce his gun and Pierce points it at Singh, suddenly Hawley kicks Singh away, then takes down the other HYDRA agents in the room before taking the gun and pointing at Pierce, she then removes her disguise to reveal it's Natasha]\nNatasha Romanoff: I'm sorry. Did I step on your moment?\nCharlie Weapons Tech: [referring to the Helicarriers] Satellites in range at three thousand feet.\nMaria Hill: Falcon, status?\nSam Wilson: Engaging. [Sam manages to fly down to the Hellicarrier bay taking down the HYDRA jets chasing him] Alright, Cap, I'm in. [just then another HYDRA jets heads his way and starts shooting at him] Shit! [Sam manages to fly off and avoid getting hit, meanwhile Steve is fighting off the HYDRA agents as he tries to get inside the Helicarrier]\nMaria Hill: Eight minutes, Cap.\nSteve Rogers: Working on it.\nCouncilman Rockwell: [to Natasha who is on the computer] What are you doing?\nAlexander Pierce: She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.\nNatasha Romanoff: Including HYDRA's.\nAlexander Pierce: And SHIELD's. If you do this, non of your past is gonna remain hidden. [Natasha continues typing into the computer] Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?\nNatasha Romanoff: Are you?\n[Control center of Helicarrier Alpha]\nSteve Rogers: Alpha locked.\nMaria Hill: Falcon, where are you now?\nSam Wilson: I had to take a detour! [Sam is flying towards one of the Helicarriers when heat-seeking missiles are shot at him by HYDRA, so he flies back towards the Helicarrier and manages to get the missiles that were aimed at him to hit the Helicarrier giving him entrance] Oh, yeah! [Sam flies into the Helicarrier; to Hill] I'm in. Bravo locked. [Sam flies out of the carrier]\nMaria Hill: Two down, one to go.\n\n\nSHIELD Pilot: All SHIELD pilots, scramble. We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got. [suddenly Bucky appears and starts firing at the SHIELD pilots and agents killing them all after which he gets into one of the jets and flies off; back inside the building with Natasha, Pierce and the council members]\nAlexander Pierce: Disabling the encryption is an executive order, it takes two Alpha Level members.\nNatasha Romanoff: Don't worry, company's coming. [just then a helicopter appears outside, lands and Fury steps out to enter the building to Pierce's surprise]\nAlexander Pierce: Did you get my flowers? [Fury looks at him coldly] I'm glad you're here, Nick.\nNick Fury: Really? Cause I thought you had me killed.\nAlexander Pierce: You know how the game works.\nNick Fury: So why make me head of SHIELD?\nAlexander Pierce: Cause you were the best and the most ruthless person I ever met.\nNick Fury: I did what I did to protect people.\nAlexander Pierce: Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid. And you know where I learned that; Bogota. You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing twenty million. It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.\nNick Fury: No, I have the courage not to. [Fury takes Pierce to the retinal scanner with Natasha pointing her gun at him]\nSHIELD Computer: Retinal scanner active.\nAlexander Pierce: You don't you think we wiped your clearance from the system?\nNick Fury: I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan, but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary... [Fury removes his eyepatch to reveal his scarred dead eye] You need to keep both eyes open. [they both look into the retinal scanner with Fury using his dead eye]\nSHIELD Computer: Alpha Level confirmed. Encryption code accepted. Safeguards removed.\n[back with Hill at the headquarters]\nMaria Hill: Charlie Carrier's forty-five degrees off the port bow. [she notices two HYDRA agents making breaking into the headquarters, she shoots and kills them as they enter] Six minutes. [Steve is trying to get away from the HYDRA agents shooting at him on the Helicarrier]\nSteve Rogers: Hey, Sam, I'm gonna need a ride.\nSam Wilson: Roger! Let me know when you're ready. [Steve just manages to jump off the edge as a HYDRA agent shoots a missile at him]\nSteve Rogers: I just did! [Sam flies in just in time to catch Steve] [Sam flies himself and Steve onto the last Helicarrier]\nSam Wilson: You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.\nSteve Rogers: I had a big breakfast. [suddenly Bucky appears and pushes Steve off the edge]\nSam Wilson: Steve! [as Sam goes to fly off and help Steve Bucky grabs one of his wings and throws him back, Sam starts shooting at Bucky and as he goes to fly off Bucky uses his weapon to rip off one of Sam's wings and kicks him off the Helicarrier, Sam manages to get his parachute out and lands on the roof of the Triskelion] Cap? Cap, come in. Are you okay? [we see Steve is holding onto the side of the Helicarrier]\nSteve Rogers: Yeah, I'm here! I'm still on the Helicarrier. [he pulls himself up] Where are you?\nSam Wilson: I'm grounded, the suit's down. Sorry, Cap.\nSteve Rogers: Don't worry, I got it. [Bucky watches Steve from above the Helicarrier] [as everyone at the Triskelion is rushing around trying to evacuate the building Rumlow fights and kills some SHIELD agents]\nSHIELD Agent: All SHIELD agents regroup at Rally Point Delta. [Romlow kills the speaker and another three agents.]\nHYDRA Dispatch: [on radio] Sir, Council's been breached.\nBrock Rumlow: Repeat, dispatch.\nHYDRA Dispatch: Black Widow's up there.\nBrock Rumlow: Headed up! [Hill notices Rumlow on the monitor]\nMaria Hill: Falcon?\nSam Wilson: Yeah?\nMaria Hill: Rumlow's headed for the Council.\nSam Wilson: I'm on it.\n\n\n[inside the Helicarrier Steve is confronted by Bucky]\nSteve Rogers: People are gonna die, Buck. I can't let that happen. [Bucky stares at him coldly] Please, don't make me do this. [seeing Bucky won't back down Steve throws his shield at him and they start battling each other, as they fight Steve manages to bring up the targeting blade system, but as Bucky attacks him the chip falls from Steve's hand; back at the Council]\nNatasha Romanoff: Done. [she looks at her mobile device] And it's trending. [just then Pierce sets off the pins he gave the council members, causing it to burn deeply into their sternum, Natasha and Fury points their guns at Pierce; to Natasha]\nAlexander Pierce: Unless you want two inch hole in your sternum, I'd put that gun down. [Natasha doesn't back down] That was armed the moment you pinned it on. [Fury and Natasha reluctantly lower their weapons]\n[back at the Helicarrier as they are battling it out, Bucky stabs Steve in the shoulder with his knife and then grabs the fallen chip, but Steve manages to get the knife out, grab Bucky by the throat and throws him down, armlocks him.]\nSteve Rogers: Drop it! Drop it! [as Bucky continues to hold the chip, Steve breaks his arm and holds onto his throat until he passes out and lets go of the chip, Steve then grabs the chip and rushes off; back at the Triskelion]\n[An office in the SHIELD HQ]\nBrock Rumlow: I'm on forty-one, headed towards the south-west stairwell. [just then Sam attacks Rumlow but Rumlow manages to knock Sam down] This is gonna hurt. There are no prisoners with HYDRA, just order. And order only comes through pain. You ready for yours?\nSam Wilson: Man, shut the hell up. [they both go to attack each other]\nAlexander Pierce: Lieutenant, how much longer?\nCharlie XO: [on radio] Sixty-five seconds to satellite link. Targeting grid engaged. Lowering weapons array now.\nMaria Hill: [to Steve as she watches from the monitor] One minute. [Steve desperately tries to get back up to the Helicarriers to get to the targeting system when Bucky becomes conscious and shoots at Steve in the left thigh and then the right shoulder, but Steve still manages to climb up] Thirty seconds, Cap!\nSteve Rogers: Stand by. [he gets the chip out] Charlie... [Bucky shoots Steve in the stomach and he falls]\n[On the helicarrier's bridge]\nCharlie Weapons Tech: We've reached three thousand feet. Sat link coming online now.\nCharlie XO: Deploy algorithm.\nCharlie Weapons Tech: Algorithm deployed.\nAlexander Pierce: [on radio] We are go to targets. [Hill watches as the weapons are being targeted at Washington, the White house, the Pentagon, Stark Tower, aiming to kill over 700,00 people.]\nCharlie Weapons Tech: Target saturation reached. All targets assigned.\nCharlie XO: Fire when ready.\nCharlie Weapons Tech: Firing in, three, two, one. [at that moment Steve manages to get up and place the chip in the Helicarrier's targeting blade overriding the system and locking it down]\nSteve Rogers: Charlie locked. [as they watch the targets go offline]\nCharlie XO: Where are the targets? Where are the targets?\nMaria Hill: Okay, Cap, get out of there. [Hill then gets the Helicarriers weapon targets to open fire upon each other]\nSteve Rogers: Fire now.\n Maria Hill: But, Steve...\nSteve Rogers: Do it! Do it now! [reluctantly Hill makes the Helicarriers open fire on each other, Steve still inside the Helicarrier looks at Bucky below him; back at the Triskelion Pierce watches the Helicarriers as they are firing at each other]\nAlexander Pierce: What a waste.\nNatasha Romanoff: Are you still on the fence about Rogers' chances?\nAlexander Pierce: Time to go, Councilwoman. This way, come on. You're gonna fly me out of here. [as Pierce starts to leave with Natasha]\nNick Fury: You know, there was a time I would have taken a bullet for you.\nAlexander Pierce: You already did. You will again when it's useful. [just then Natasha activates a small disc that emits an electric shock through her whole body and disables the pin, this gives Fury a chance to shoot Pierce, which he does so twice, Fury then walks over to Natasha who is lying unconscious on the floor]\nNick Fury: Romanoff! Natasha! Natasha, come on! [Natasha opens her eyes]\nNatasha Romanoff: Ow. Those really do sting.\nAlexander Pierce: [as the Helicarriers continue to destroy each other Pierce lies on the floor and says with his last dieing breath] Hail HYDRA. [just then one Helicarrier crashes into a dam beneath the Triskelion] [as the Helicarrier continues to fall with Cap and Winter Soldier inside, at the Triskelion Sam and Rumlow continue to fight each other]\nBrock Rumlow: You're out of your depth, kid. [suddenly the first Helicarrier crashes into the Triskelion, catching Rumlow in the destruction]\nSam Wilson: [to Natasha who is in the helicopter as he sprints away] Please, tell me you got that chopper in the air!\nNatasha Romanoff: Sam, where are you?\nSam Wilson: 41st floor, north-west corner!\nNatasha Romanoff: We're on it, stay where you are. [Sam desperately tries to get away from the destruction the Helicarrier is causing to the building] Not an option! [as the building is being destroyed Sam jumps out of the window as Natasha and Fury fly their chopper barely in time to catch him]\nSam Wilson: 41st floor! 41st!\nNick Fury: It's not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building!\nNatasha Romanoff: Hill, where's Steve? You got a location on Rogers?\n[inside the third Helicarrier we see Steve help Bucky out from being trapped under some fallen rubble]\nSteve Rogers: You know me. [Bucky lashes out at Steve in anger]\nBucky Barnes: No, I don't!\nSteve Rogers: Bucky, you've known me your whole life. [Bucky hits Steve but Steve chooses not to fight back] Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. [Bucky hits Steve again]\nBucky Barnes: Shut up! [Steve takes off his mask and drops his shield out of the Helicarrier]\nSteve Rogers: I'm not gonna fight you. You're my friend. [Bucky pushes Steve to the ground]\nBucky Barnes: You're my mission. [he then mercilessly punches Steve repeatedly across the face] You're my mission!\nSteve Rogers: Then finish it. [Bucky hesitates holding his fist up] Cause I'm with you to the end of the line. [Bucky looks at Steve as if he's starting to remember just then the bottom of the Helicarrier falls sending Steve down into the river below as Bucky watches from the Helicarrier, then we see an unconscious Steve being pulled out of the water and dragged onto the shore by Bucky before he turns and walks away]\n\n\n[In a hospital, in a room guarded by two armed agents, we see Steve waking up in a bed to hear Marvin Gaye's \"Trouble Man\" playing with Sam sat next to his bed]\nSteve Rogers: On your left. [Sam looks at Steve and smiles]\n[we then see Agent 13 practicing shooting at a shooting range wearing a CIA t-shirt; we see Hill at Stark Industries about to undergo a lie detector test; then Senator Stern getting arrested and then a badly burnt Rumlow being treated by doctors at the hospital; Natasha is then being sworn in at a committee hearing]\nBailiff: Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\nNatasha Romanoff: I do.\nCommittee General: Why haven't we yet heard from Captain Rogers?\nNatasha Romanoff: I don't know what there is left left for him to say. I think the wreck in the middle of the Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.\nCommittee General: Well, he could explain how this country's expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus.\nNatasha Romanoff: HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence.\nCommittee General: Many of which you seem to have had a personal hand in telling.\nScudder: Agent, you should know that there are some on this committee who feel, given your service record, both for this country and against it, that you belong in a penitentiary, not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.\nNatasha Romanoff: You're not gonna put me in a prison. You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?\nScudder: Do enlighten us.\nNatasha Romanoff: Because you need us. Yes, the world is a vulnerable place, and yes, we helped make it that way. But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it. So if you want to arrest me, arrest me. You'll know where to find me. [she gets up and walks away, meanwhile Fury gets rid of any trace of his existence, including his passports and eyepatch, burning them and his hiding place]\n\n\nNick Fury: [wearing sunglasses and hoodie, Fury meets Steve and Sam at a cemetery at his own grave] So, you've experienced this sort of thing before?\nSteve Rogers: You get used to it. [we see Fury's gravestone which bears bears the epitaph \"The path of the righteous man. Ezekiel 25:17\"]\nNick Fury: We've been data-mining HYDRA's files. Looks like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship. I'm headed to Europe tonight, wanted to ask if you'd come.\nSteve Rogers: There's something I gotta do first.\nNick Fury: How about you, Wilson? Could use a man with your abilities.\nSam Wilson: I'm more of a soldier than a spy.\nNick Fury: Alright then. [Sam and Steve shake Fury's hand] Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me right here. [Fury looks to his gravestone and walks away, just then Natasha joins Steve and Sam]\nNatasha Romanoff: You should be honored, that's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.\nSteve Rogers: Not going with him?\nNatasha Romanoff: No.\nSteve Rogers: Not staying here?\nNatasha Romanoff: I blew all my covers, I gotta go figure out a new one.\nSteve Rogers: That might take a while.\nNatasha Romanoff: I'm counting on it. That thing you asked for, I called in a few favors from Kiev. [she hands Steve a file titled \"\u0434\u0435\u043b\u043e No 17\" (file No 17)] Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.\nSteve Rogers: She's not a nurse.\nNatasha Romanoff: And you're not a SHIELD agent.\nSteve Rogers: What was her name again?\nNatasha Romanoff: Sharon. She's nice. [she kisses Steve on the cheek and turns to walk away] Be careful, Steve. You might not want to pull on that thread. [as Natasha walks away Steve opens the file, which is about Bucky and the information regarding his Winter Soldier transformation, Sam walks over to Steve]\nSam Wilson: You're going after him?\nSteve Rogers: You don't have to come with me.\nSam Wilson: I know. When do we start?\n\n\n[mid-credits scene; at an underground HYDRA lab Baron Wolfgang von Strucker is talking with a HYDRA scientist]\nList: It's over. Fury has released everything to the public.\nBaron Wolfgang von Strucker: Everything he knows about.\nList: Herr Strucker, if they get word of our work here, if they find out we serve HYDRA...\nBaron Wolfgang von Strucker: HYDRA, SHIELD, two sides of a coin that's no longer currency. [they walk over to the corner of the lab where Loki's scepter is being kept] What we have is worth more than any of them ever knew. We've only scratched the surface and already... [they start walking out of the lab] There are other facilities doing HYDRA's good work around the world. We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends. Keep them off our scent.\nList: What about the volunteers?\nBaron Wolfgang von Strucker: The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won't be able to find them.\nList: And the survivors?\nBaron Wolfgang von Strucker: The twins. [we see the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, being kept in glass cells each exhibiting their powers, Pietro having superhuman speed and Wanda having telekinetic powers] Sooner or later they will meet the twins. It's not a world of spies anymore, not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, doctor. There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.\n\n\n[post-credits scene; at the Captain America exhibit in the Smithsonian Museum we see Bucky in civilian clothes staring pensively at the display about himself]\n[End of Captain America: The Winter Soldier]\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "[Early morning, Carol has woken up from a dream and is now standing outside Yon-Rogg's room. When she knocks, Yon-Roog answers the door still half-asleep]\nYON-ROGG [annoyed and tired]: Do you know what time it is?\nCAROL: Can't sleep.\nYON-ROGG: There are tabs for that.\nCAROL:\u00a0Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.\nYON-ROGG:\u00a0Dreams again?\n(Carol nods in response. Yon-Rogg does so as well.)\nCAROL:\u00a0Wanna fight?\n[Scene changes to Carol falling over. The camera then pans to show a doji-like structure, with Carol and Yon-Rogg on a mat]\nCAROL:\u00a0I slipped.\nYON-ROGG: Right. You slipped as a result of me punching you in the face.\nCAROL: I was already slipping when you happened to punch me in the face. The two events are not related.\nYON-ROGG [amused]: Tell me about this dream.\n[Carol and Yon-Rogg start to spar]\nYON-ROGG: Anything new?\nCAROL: No.\n[Carol and Yon-Rogg continue to spar. Yon-Rogg grabs Carol's right arm and pins it behind her]\nYON-ROGG: You've got to let go of your past.\nCAROL: I don't remember my past.\nYON-ROGG: It's causing you doubt, and doubt makes you vulnerable.\n[Yon-Rogg lets go of Carol's arm and they continue to spar. Carol then is forced onto the floor, and her fist begins to glow orange]\nYON-ROGG: Control it.\n[Carol's fist returns to normal]\nYON-ROGG: Lose control again and you'll have to convene with the Supreme Intelligence. There is nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion.\n[Carols smirks at Yon-Rogg causing Yon-Rogg to push her backwards]\nYON-ROGG: Humor is a distraction. And anger? Anger only serves the enemy.\n[Yon-Rogg continue to fight. Yon-Rogg puches Carol in the face causing her to fall down. Carol retaliates by shooting energy from her fist, resulting in Yon-Rogg flying backwards]\n[Scene changes to outside of a futuristic train station. There are electronic billboards on buildings, and blue and orange lights can be seen through windows]\nElectronic Voice-Over (from billboard): 120 days since the last Skrull attack.\n[The scene then changes to Carol and Yon-Rogg inside of a train carrage, surrounded by other Kree]\nCarol: Has anybody seen what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?\nYon-Rogg: No-one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form. You know that. Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us. So it's sacred, it's personal. The Kree divulges it ever.\nCarol: Who do you see? Your brother?\nYon-Rogg: No.\nCarol: Father?\nYon-Rogg (annoyed):\u00a0No\nCarol: Your old commander?\nYon-Rogg: Vers...\nCarol (smug): It's me you see, isn't it?\nYon-Rogg (amused): I see what you're trying to do.\nCarol (laughing): Is it working?\nYon-Rogg: Yes. But you won't succeed in changing my mind on the subject.\nCarol: What is the point of giving me these [gestures to her hands] if you don't want me to use them?\nYon-Rogg: You're going to use them. The Supreme Intelligence made me the responsibility of showing you how to use them.\nCarol: I know how.\nYon-Rogg: Well if that were true, you'd knock me down without them.\n[Carol pulls a face then punches Yon-Rogg in his arm]\nYon-Rogg: Control your impulses. Stop using this [points to her chest, above her heart] and start using this [gestures towards her head]. I need you to be the best version of yourself.\n[Scene changes to the inside of the Supreme Intelligence. The walls appear golden, with pillars wider towards the top and narrowing towards the bottom. The floor has a hexagon lit up with white light. Carol walks onto the hexagon and extends her arms beside her. Tentacle-like wires appear from below her feet and connect to her legs, arms, and head.]\n[The scene changes again, but the wires have disappeared and the walls have been replaced with an endless glossy floor. Lights then descend from above and the Supreme Intelligence appears from within them.]\nSupreme Intelligence: Vers.\nCarol: Intelligence.\nSupreme Intelligence: Your commander insists that you're fit to serve.\nCarol:\u00a0I am.\nSupreme Intelligence: You struggle with your emotions, with your past which fuels them.\n[A floating image of the Earth appears, which Carol turns to look at. The image then turns into a variety of planets, with the camera switching slowly between them.]\nSupreme Intelligence: You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion that has threatened our civilisation for centuries. Imposters who silently infiltrate then take over our planets.\n[The image then zooms into one of the planets, revealing a Skrull carrying a weapon similar to in Carol's dream.]\nSupreme Intelligence: Horrors which you remember and so much which you do not.\nCarol: It's all... blank. My life. You're supposed to take the form of you I most admire but I don't even remember who this person was to me.\nSupreme Intelligence: Perhaps this is a mercy, sparing you from a deeper pain. Freeing you to do what all Kree must. Put your people's needs before your own. We've given you a great gift, a chance to fight for the good of all Kree.\n[The chip on Carol's neck begins to blink, almost simultaneously her hands begin to glow.]\nCarol: I want to serve.\nSupreme Intelligence: Then master yourself; what was given can be taken away.\n[Carol's chip and her hand stop glowing]\nCarol: I won't let you down.\nSupreme Intelligence: We'll know soon enough. You have a mission. Serve well and with honor.\n[The scene suddenly changes back to inside the Supreme Intelligence building and the wires slide back to underneath Carol's feet.]\n[The scene changes to a shot of Carol, and Yon-Rogg's team walking towards a space ship within a hanger. The hanger is large, the walls are golden, and the team is wearing a green and black uniform.]\nAtt-Lass: This can't be good.\nKorath: It must be another Skrull attack.\nBron-Char: Whatever it is, it's big.\nMinn-Erva: Has a Skrull ever simmed you?\nKorath: Once. It was deeply disturbing.\nCarol: Why?\nKorath: Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy and the face staring back was my own.\nCarol: Well maybe if you were more attractive then it would be less disturbing.\nKorath: You think you're funny, but I'm not laughing.\nAtt-Lass: You never laugh.\nKorath: I laugh on the inside. I'm not doing it now.\nBron-Char: It's funny cause objectively speaking, you're quite handsome.\nKorath: Well thank you.\nYon-Rogg: Listen up team! Knock it off (pointing at Carol).\n[Yon-Rogg walks into the center of the plane and begins presenting a holographic presentation.]\nYon-Rogg: Alright, prepare for a search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr. The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet, this time Torfa. Soh-Larr sent a warning signal, which we've intercepted, that his cover's blown. The Skrull General Talos has sent kill units to find him. Should they reach him before we do, the intelligence he has acquired over three years is as good as theirs. The accusors will bomb a Skrull stronghold here in the south. We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr and we get out, leaving them none the wiser. The Torfa populace; we are not to interfere with them nor them with us. Nothing compromises the security of our mission. Proceed with caution. Follow protocol before extracting him.\n[The holograph disappears, leaving the team standing in a circle.]\nYon-Rogg: This is a dangerous mission, we must all be ready to join the collective if that is our fate today. For the good of all Kree!\nCarol, Bron-Char, Korath, Minn-Erva and Att-Lass: For the good of all Kree!\n[The scene changes to show the ship and the Accusor's ships flying out of the hanger and towards the horizon towards a jump hole. Once they all pass through the jump hole, the scene changes to show the ships leaving the hole, surrounded by empty space and approaching the planet Torfa.]\n[The Accusor's ships begin firing missiles down towards the Skrull stronghold down on Torfa. The ship containing Carol, Yon-Rogg and the other Kree follows after the missiles and crash lands in the sea. Carol and the Kree then emerge from the ship wearing masks and their green and black uniform. The Kree then swim from their ship before removing their masks.]\nYon-Rogg: Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon. Att-Lass and Minn-Erva find elevation.\n[The camera follows the Kree sneaking towards the stronghold, amongst pillars of rock and mountains.]\nMinn-Erva: Locals on the periphery. Maybe a dozen.\n[Static noise is heard coming from Yon-Rogg's earwig]\nYon-Rogg: Minn-Erva?\nMinn-Erva: Do you read me? Anybody copy?\n[Static noise is heard coming from Yon-Rogg's earwig.]\nYon-Rogg: Repeat.\nCarol: His beacon's coming from that temple. Let's move.\nYon-Rogg: No. This is the perfect spot for an ambush. Only one way in, only one way out.\nBron-Char: And we have to pass the locals.\nYon-Rogg: We don't know if they are locals. Too risky.\nCarol: You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.\nYon-Rogg: No! You won't.\n[Yon-Rogg looks around, assessing his surroundings.]\nYon-Rogg: Right. Keep a close radius, we lose comms we meet back at the Helion. Come on.\n[The scene then changes to show the thermal imaging through one of the Kree's guns, showing the locals moving towards an area.]\nMinn-Erva: Att-Lass, you getting this?\nAtt-Lass: Copy. I see them.\n[The scene changes to the Kree walking amongst pillars of rock towards the local's campsite.]\nLocals: {Untranslated syllables}\nYon-Rogg: Get back!\nBron-Char: Commander!\nYon-Rogg: Get back. Back!\nLocals: [commotion amongst the group]\nYon-Rogg: Minn-Erva, do you have eyes on this?\n[The Kree draw their weapons and face the locals.]\nYon-Rogg: (to the locals) Get back! Minn-Erva!\nMinn-Erva: Does anybody copy?\nLocals: {untranslated syllables} [commotion amongst the group]\nYon-Rogg: I don't want to hurt you. Get back! Stay back!\n[The scene changes to the view through Minn-Erva's gun. The locals continue to move towards the Kree, and Minn-Erva prepares to shoot before Att-Lass lowers her gun.]\nAtt-Lass: They're locals. I found two dead, no green. They're just starving.\n[Minn-Erva sees Soh-Lah fighting against the locals through the scope of her gun. Att-Lass begins to fight Minn-Erva, before Minn-Erva shoots him in the chest]\n[The scene changes to Carol trying to locate Soh-Larr in the temple. When she sees somebody, the tablet in her arm lights up showing a string of characters.]\nCarol: HGX-78\nSoh-Larr: TRT79-VVX6\n[The scene changes back to Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char surrounded by the locals]\nLocals: {untranslated shouting}\nBron-Char: Get back!\n[One of the locals draws a Skrull weapon before being shot by Minn-Erva. Minn-Erva continues to shoot the locals surrounding Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char]\nYon-Rogg: Skrulls!\n[The scene changes back to Carol and Soh-Larr, with Soh-Larr sitting exhausted against a rock.]\nYon-Rogg (through Carol's earpiece): Vers? Skrulls! It's an ambush.\n[Soh-Larr shocks Carol with a Skrull weapon, paralyzing her.] \n[The locals begin screaming before transforming into Skrulls and drawing their weapon. They then charge towards Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char and begin a firefight.]\nYon-Rogg: Vers!\nBron-Char: Incoming!\nYon-Rogg: Back to the Helion!\n[The scene changes back to Carol and Soh-Larr. Carol has just regained movement, however, Soh-Larr has transformed into Skrull General Talos.]\nYon-Rogg (through Carol's earpiece): Vers? Do you copy?\nCarol: How did you know the code?\nGeneral Talos: How about I tell you my secret? When you tell me yours?\n[General Talos tasers Carol before the screen turns black.]\nSkrull Tech (voiceover): Let's open her up.\n[The scene changes to a flashback of Carol at an Airforce base. The camera is pointed towards the nose of a plane and the hangar door is opening. The angle changes to follow Carol walking towards a fighter plane.]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Where are we?\nSkrull Scientist (voiceover): Stand by.\n[The angle widens to show a circle of planes sitting on the tarmac.]\nMaria: Where's your head at?\nCarol: In the clouds. Where's yours?\nMaria: On my shoulders. About to show these boys how to do it. You ready?\nCarol: Higher, further, faster baby.\nMaria: That's right.\n[The scene changes to show Maria and Carol climbing into their cockpits and preparing to fly.]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover):\u00a0This can't be right.\n[The scene then changes to show Carol and Monica's planes taking off, before switching to a shot of Carol flying.]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover):\u00a0Go back even further.\n[The camera spins to change from a scene of Carol flying to a scene of 11-year old Carol driving around a go-kart track at a fair.]\nBoy: You're going too fast. You need to go slow.\n[Carol speeds up but crashes into the hay outlining the track. As the car tumbles, Carol sees flashes of orange and blue light similar to that of her energy blasts.]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Who is this person? Are we in the right...?\nCarol's Father: What the hell are you thinking? You don't belong out here!\nSkrull Scientist (voiveover): I think we went back too far.\nCarol (11-years old): You let him drive.\nSkrull Scientist (voiceover): Let me try something.\n[The scene changes again to show Carol hanging onto a rope to complete a ropes course in Air-Force training. She stares at the rope in front of her.]\nCadets: You don't belong out here! You're not strong enough! You'll kill yourself!\n[Carol swings back on the rope, before jumping off and trying to grab the rope in front of her. She grabs it, however, she loses grip and falls to the ground. When she hits the ground, there is an image of her thrown backward because of blue and orange flames, before the image returns to her hitting the ground on the course. The cadets laugh behind her]\nDrill Instructor: They'll never let you fly.\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Am I the only one who's confused here?\n[The scene changes again to the inside of a bar, with Carol sitting at a table with Maria and another pilot standing next to her]\nPilot: You're a decent pilot, but you're too emotional. You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?\n[The camera changes to show a pool table. When a ball hits the table, the image changes to a small flash of blue light before changing back to the table]\n[The camera then shows Carol's brother and Carol at six lying in the grass]\nCarol's Brother: Huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon and the sun and the stars in the sky. And so, little Alouette flew up throughout the night.\nCarol (6-years-old): Did you see her? (referring to a shooting star which just passed by) It's Alouette.\n[The scene changes again to show a Carol and Maria's daughter lying in the grass outside Maria's house]\nMaria: Get your butt's inside, it's time to eat.\nCarol: Prepare for takeoff Lieutenant Trouble.\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Charming memory.\nSkrull Scientist (voiceover): Hang on. I think I got it.\n[The scene changes to show Carol leaning against her car outside of an airplane hanger, with Goose walking towards her. Carol leans down to pet Goose before Dr. Wendy Lawson walks towards her]\nWendy Lawson: Goose likes you. She doesn't typically take to people.\nCarol: Early start to your morning.\nWendy Lawson: Ah. Late night actually, I can't sleep when there's work to do. Sound familiar?\nCarol: Flying airplanes never feels like work.\n[Wendy and Carol turn to look at the airplanes which are taking off and landing]\nWendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?\nCarol: I prefer the view from up there.\nWendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough Ace.\n[Wendy Lawson turns around and walks away]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Wait, wait, wait. That's her. Get her back.\nSkrull Scientist (voiceover): Stand by.\nWendy Lawson: Sound familiar?\n[Carol turns around to see Wendy standing behind her]\nWendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?\nCarol: I prefer the view from up there.\nWendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough...\n[Wendy Lawson turns around and walks away]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): What's that on her shirt? I couldn't read it.\nWendy Lawson: Sound familiar?\n[Carol turns around to see Wendy standing behind her]\nWendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?\nCarol: I prefer the view from up there.\nWendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough...\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Focus.\nCarol: Excuse me?\n[Wendy Lawson talks, however her voice is drowned out by General Talos' voiceover]\nGeneral Talos\u00a0(voiceover): Look down.\n[The camera pans down to the nametag on Wendy Lawson's shirt]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Focus. Pegasus, Dr. Wendy Lawson. That's her.\nCarol: Can you hear that?\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Do we have the location?\n[The camera shows Carol continuing to talk, but a flash of blue lighting interrupts the scene, before returning to Carol talking to Wendy]\nSkrull Tech (voiceover): Got it.\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature.\n[The scene changes back to Carol's dream, where Lawson is holding a gun towards an unknown person]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Interesting.\n[Carol's dream sequence continues through General Talos' voiceovers]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Huh. Hold on. Go back right before this. Go back.\n[Once General Talos fires his weapon, the scene changes to Carol in a dogfight. General Talos continues to talk to Carol, but Carol is beginning to resist]\nCarol: That's no MIG, Lawson.\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): This is it. Now, let me see where you're headed. That's right, look at the coordinates. (Carol begins having flashbacks to directly after the explosion) Focus. (Carol shuts here eyes) Open, please. That's it. That's it. (Carol begins looking at the coordinates, but her vision is fuzzy) You're almost there. You're almost there. (Carol shuts her eyes, squeezing them shut) Don't fight it. (Carol's visions about the explosion come back, this time focusing on the fire around the plane) Focus!\n[Carol ejects herself from the plane, descends down to Earth, and shuts her eyes]\nGeneral Talos (voiceover): Get her back. Get her back now!\n[When Carol opens her eyes, the scene suddenly changes to Carol with electricity running from a machine to her temples. Her vision is blurring, but shadows of upside-down Skrulls can be seen. As Carol looks around, the camera shows her restrained and hanging upside-down inside of a Skrull warship]\nSkrull Scientist: This doesn't make any sense.\nGeneral Talos: Do we have any information we can act on?\nSkrull Scientist: Just that Lawson was somewhere on the Planet C53. We're on our way.\nGeneral Talos: Then dig, dig, dig, deeper. Lawson is our link to that lightspeed engine!\u00a0And everything we're after...\n[A Skrull taps Carol in the center of her forehead, which changes an image on a screen]\nGeneral Talos: Oh. That did something. Try that again.\n[The Skrull taps Carol on the forehead twice, before noticing that Carol's metal restraints are beginning to glow orange]\nSkrull: Oh-uh.\n[Carol begins free from the restraints and begins to fight the Skrulls, one of the Skrulls raises their weapon, but General Talos lowers it]\nGeneral Talos: Not yet!\n[Carol fights the Skrulls in the room, before confronting Talos. Carol pushes Talos against a table, and holds a glowing orange restraint against his head]\nCarol: What did you do to me?!\nGeneral Talos: We're just after a little information.\nCarol: What did you put in my head?\nGeneral Talos: Nothing that wasn't already there.\nCarol: But those aren't my memories.\nGeneral Talos: Yeah, its like a bad trip in there. I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight. They really did a number on you.\nCarol: Enough of your mind games! What do you want?\nGeneral Talos: We're looking for the location of a Doctor Lawson and her light speed engine.\nCarol: I don't know any Doctor Lawson.\nGeneral Talos: Then why is she in your head?\n[Skrulls begin running into the room from all different corridors. Carol throws General Talos against them before running off barefooted. Carol then runs around the ship, trying to find an exit, while fighting of the Skrulls, before she is stuck between two parties of advancing Skrulls]\nCarol: You wouldn't know how these things come off would ya? No? Fine.\n[Carol begins fighting the Skrulls, with her hands still in the restraints. Once she has defeated the Skrulls, she runs off again before being confronted by General Talos and two others. She presses the pad to open the door with her bare foot. During this fight, she manages to free herself from the restraints by blasting energy from her hands until they break. However, this causes the glass of the ship to crack and Carol to be pulled outside. She then uses the energy in her hands to fly inside towards the room where she was held captive]\nCarol: Hey!\n[The Skrulls working at the computers put their hands up in surrender, but Carol just picks up her shoes before fighting a Skrull for an escape pod, attracting the attention of Talos]\nTalos: Leaving so soon? We're just getting to know each other.\n[Carol blasts a wave of energy towards Talos' head, which he ducks underneath. Carol continues starting the pod and flys down to Earth. On the flight down, the pod begins to break, and Carol is forced out and is thrown down into a Blockbuster store]\n[The scene changes to the inside of an empty Blockbuster store. The lights are on and hanging at angles, the shelves are half-empty and Carol is covered in material from the roof. Carol stands up slowly and turns in a circle, taking in her surroundings. When she turns around and sees a life-size poster, she shoots an energy blast towards it, causing the head to fall off and the neck to erupt in flames]\nCarol: Vers to Star Force Command. Do you read me?\n[Carol begins to walk through an aisle, looking at the movies on the shelf]\nCarol: Hello? Do you copy?\n[Carol stops, picks up a movie and reads the summary. She becomes intrigued with something outside, and walks towards it. The scene then changes to a shopping strip, outside of the Blockbuster. Carol wipes dust off of her shoulders before walking towards a car and knocking on its window]\nCarol: Hi, I'm Vers. Kree Star Force. Is this C-53? Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working?\nSecurity Officer: Yeah, I understand you.\nCarol: Oh, good. Are you in charge of security for this district?\nSecurity Officer: Sort of. The movie theatre has its own guy.\nCarol: Where can I find communications equipment?\n[The security officer points towards Radio Shack]\nCarol: Thank you.\n[The scene changes to a shot of Skrulls walking towards the beach from within the waves. They look around, trying to find a person to imitate. General Talos finds a young women surfing, and changes into her]\nGeneral Talos: Track the pod, find the girl. She knows more than she knows.\n[The scene changes to show that the three Skrulls have also changed into surfers from the beach, however Talos and another are identical]\nGeneral Talos: Hey, this one's taken.\n[The scene changes back to the shopping strip, now in daylight. Carol is tinkering with her communications equipment with parts from Radio Shack and a payphone. She turns on her communicator and calls Yon-Rogg. The camera switches between Carol at the shopping strip and Yon-Rogg on the ship]\nCarol:\u00a0Come on.\nYon-Rogg: Vers. Verify, CTC39.\nCarol: GRX31600, and I'm fine thank you for asking. Is everyone ok, what happened?\nYon-Rogg: Skrull ambush. I thought we'd lost you. Did you find Soh-Larr?\nCarol: It wasn't Soh-Larr. Talos simmed him, even knew his code.\nYon-Rogg: That's impossible. That code was buried in his unconscious.\nCarol: The Skrulls messed with my mind. The machine that they used, I think it was how they extracted Soh-Larr's code.\nYon-Rogg: Vers, where are you?\nCarol: I'm on planet C-53. The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson.\nYon-Rogg: Who?\nCarol: She's... who I see...\nYon-Rogg: She's what? Vers. Vers, what?\nCarol: She's a scientist. They think that she's cracked the code on light speed tech. I have to get to her before they do, or else they'll be able to invade new galaxies.\nYon-Rogg: No. You've been caught once already. How far to C-53?\nBron-Char: Closest jump point is 22 hours.\nYon-Rogg: Vers. Hold your position until we get there, keep your comms online so that we can contact you.\nCarol: No! What if they get a hold of it before...\n[The payphone disconnects. The camera shows Yon-Rogg on the ship]\nYon-Rogg: Vers? Vers!\nKorath: If the Skrulls have got to her, she's compromised.\nYon-Rogg: She's stronger than you think.\nBron-Char: Have you visited C-53?\nMinn-Erva: Once, it's a real shithole.\n[Camera switches back to Carol standing in the phone booth. Police cars speed down the road behind her before turning and parking outside the Blockbuster store. Phill Coulsen and Nick Fury step out of an unmarked police car. Coulsen walks towards the security car, while Fury begins to examine the store]\nCoulsen: You call this in?\n[The security guard nods before pointing at Carol. Carol is then seen activating her beacon, while Nick Fury walks up behind her and taps on the glass surrounding the phone booth]\nFury: Excuse me miss, do you know anything about a lady who went through the roof of that Blockbuster over there? Witness says she was dressed for laser tag.\nCarol: Oh. Yeah, I think she went that way.\n[Carol tries to walk off, but Fury steps in front of her]\nFury: Ah. I'd like to ask you some questions. Maybe give you the 4-1-1 on late night drop-bys. Could I see some identification, please?\nCarol: Vers. Kree Star Force. We don't carry identification on metal cards.\n[Carol tries to walk off again, and Fury stops her]\nFury: Vers. Star Force. How long are you planning on being in town?\nCarol: Oh, I'll be out of your hair as soon as I track down the Skrulls which are infiltrating your planet.\nFury: Skrulls?\nCarol: Shape-shifters. They can transform into any lifeform down to the DNA. Oh boy, you guys don't have a clue do you?\nFury: Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hold on. How do we know that you're not one of those... shapeshifters?\nCarol: Congratulations Agent Fury. You have finally asked a relevant question.\nFury: Oh! Congratulations to you Star Force Lady. You're under arrest.\n[A policewoman steps forward to arrest Carol, however, Carol sees one of the Skrulls from the beach on a nearby rooftop and shoots an energy blast at them. Carol then runs towards the building, and Fury grabs his gun and runs towards the car. The Skrull runs across the rooftop, jumping over pipes while Fury runs along the footpath at the front of the building. The Skrull runs up the stairs, towards a train and transforms into an old lady who exits the train in front of him. Carol jumps up to the platform and runs into the same old lady. Carol then chases the train down the platform and jumps on top of it. Fury sees Carol hanging onto the train and turns the car around to pursue it. Carol then walks through the train, observing all the passengers (while noticing Stan Lee saying \"Trust me, true believer. Trust me\" from the script of Mallrats) before seeing the old lady. Carol then punches her, causing a fight before being pulled off the lady by a group of passengers. The lady escapes before changing into one of the men and walking into the next carriage and jumping onto the roof. Carol follows the man onto the roof and continues to fight him. Fury's car continues to follow the train track, barely avoiding the carnage being thrown off the roof by Carol and the Skrull]\nCoulson: Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.\nFury: Let's greet them at the station.\nCoulon (over comms): Fury, this is Agent Colson. Umm, I'm still here at the Blockbuster and where did everybody go? I've finished collecting evidence.\n[The Skrull disguised as Coulsen draws his weapon and points it towards Fury. They struggle for the gun before Fury turns the car into an oncoming bus, killing the Skrull]\n[The scene changes to Carol alone outside of a building. She places a Skrull USB into the computer attached to her arm and looks through the file, containing information from her interrogation. The computer shows different images from her interrogation before it sparks and Carol removes the USB. The scene then changes to Carol inside of an internet Cafe, googling the information from the Skrull's. The scene changes again, this time to Carol standing outside of the Cafe holding a map. A biker comes along and parks next to where Carol is standing]\nBiker: Nice scuba suit.\n[The biker revs his engine, causing Carol to look towards him before looking back at her map]\nBiker: Line up honey, heh? Got a smile for me?\n[The biker then enters the shop. Carol then looks towards the bike again before taking some clothes from a nearby store and leaving on the bike]\n[The scene then changes to the autopsy of the dead Skrull]\nMedical Examiner: All life on Earth is carbon-based, not this guy. Whatever he runs on, it's not on the periodic table.\nFury: You're saying he's not from around here?\nMedical Examiner: Hey, how's your eye?\nFury: Well, I'd say fine. But it can't believe what it's seeing.\nDirector: You said, that this thing looked like Coulson?\nFury: Talked like him too.\nDirector: The woman said that there were more?\nFury: The word she used was infiltration.\nDirector: Belive her?\nFury: Not 'till I say this.\nDirector: What's your plan?\nFury: I got to find Blockbuster girl. I got word on a motorcycle thief which fits her description. She can tell us why these lizards are here, maybe she can tell us how to kick them to the curb.\nDirector: Good. Do it alone though. Can't trust anyone. Not even our own men.\nFury: Yes sir.\n[Fury walks away, leaving the Director of SHIELD and the Medical Examiner with the dead Skrull]\nDirector: Wow, they're ugly bastards aren't they?\nMedical Examiner: Yeah, well. They're not Brad Pitt sir.\n[The Directors leans down until he's just above the dead Skrull]\nDirector (whispers): Safe journey to the beyond my friend. I will finish what we started.\nMedical Examiner: I wouldn't get too close there boss.\nDirector: No-one in or out.\n[The scene changes to Carol driving the motorcycle across the desert on an almost empty highway. She overtakes a car, then pulls into a parking lot outside of a bar before walking inside. Carol looks around, remembering the vision from the Skrull interrogation of her and Maria inside the bar. The camera pans to show visions of Carol playing an arcade game, drinking with Maria and singing karaoke. Carol then walks over to a wall covered in pictures of Air Force fighter jets, before fixating on one with the Pegasus logo on the tail. While Carol is looking at the photos, the bartender walks past her]\nBartender: What can I get ya?\nCarol: Where was this photograph taken?\nBartender: At an airport?\nCarol: Where's Pegasus?\nFury: That's classified. Not unlike the file I started on you.\n[Carol then walks behind the bartender and into view. The bartender then walks away confused]\nFury: But I see you changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you.\nCarol: Did you have a rough day Agent Fury?\nFury: It's cool. You know, space invasion, big car chase, got to watch an alien autopsy. Typical 9 to 5.\nCarol: So you saw one?\nFury: I was never one to believe in aliens. But I can't unsee that.\nCarol: This is gonna get a little awkward but I gotta ask.\nFury: You think I'm one of those green things.\nCarol: Can't be too careful.\nFury: You are looking at 100 percent red-blooded Earthman.\nCarol: I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.\nFury: We talking cheek swab or urine sample.\nCarol: No. The DNA would match.\nFury: Well my AOL password.\nCarol: Skrulls can only assume recent memories of their host bodies.\nFury: Oh oh! You wanna get personal.\nCarol: Where were you born?\nFury: Huntsville, Alabama. But technically I don't remember that part.\nCarol: Name of your first pet.\nFury: Mr. Snuffers.\nCarol: Mr. Snuffers?\nFury: That's what I said. Did I pass?\nCarol: Not yet. First job?\nFury: Soldier, straight out of high school. Got the ranks of full breed Colonel.\nCarol: And then?\nFury: Spy.\nCarol: Where?\nFury: It was the Cold War, we were everywhere. Uh... Belfast, Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest.\nCarol: Now?\nFury: Been riding a desk for the past few years, trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from. Never occurred to me that they'd be coming from above.\nCarol: Name a detail so bizarre a Skrull could never fabricate it.\nFury: If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it. You didn't need that did you?\nCarol: No. No, I didn't. But I enjoyed it.\nFury: Ok. Your turn. Prove you're\u00a0not a Skrull.\n[Carol calmly blasts energy out of her fists towards a jukebox on the opposite side of the room before resting her head back on her fist. Fury continues to look towards the jukebox, both concerned and confused]\nFury: And how is that supposed to prove to me that your not a Skrull?\nCarol: It's a photon blast.\nFury: And...?\nCarol: A Skrull can't do that. So a full-bred colonel turned spy turned SHIELD agent must have pretty high-security clearance. Where's Pegasus?\n[The scene changes to a black car driving through an empty highway next to a mountain, before changing to the inside of the car showing Fury driving and Carol in the passenger seat]\nFury: So the Skrulls are alien races which infiltrate and overtake alien planets. And you're a Kree, a race of noble warriors.\nCarol: Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.\nFury: So um. What do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?\nCarol: They believe she developed a light speed engine at Pegasus.\nFury: Light speed engine? I've got to admit, that's not the craziest thing I've heard today.\nCarol: Well, it's still early.\nFury: And you, what do you want?\nCarol: To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable.\nFury: And...? Look, war is a universal language. I know a rogue soldier when I see one, you've got a personal stake in this.\n[The camera pans out to show the car arriving at a bunker. It then follows the car down the driveway and towards the security checkpoint]\nSecurity Checkpoint: This is a government property, turn your vehicle around.\nFury: Nicholas Joseph Fury, Agent of SHIELD.\nSecurity Checkpoint: Place your thumb on the pad. One moment.\nCarol: Nicholas Joseph Fury, you have three names?\nFury: Everybody calls me Fury. Not Nicholas, not Joseph, not Nick. Just Fury.\nCarol: What does your mom call you?\nFury: Fury.\nCarol: What do you call her?\nFury: Fury.\nCarol: What about your kids?\nFury: If I have them, they'll call me Fury.\nSecurity Checkpoint: You're cleared for access.\nFury: Thank you.\n[The gate in front of the bar opens and the car drives down the driveway and into a tunnel. The writing \"Project Pegasus, Joint NASA USAF Facility\" appear on the screen when the car enters the tunnel. Fury continues to drive through the tunnel before reaching the end and parking beside another car. Carol and himself step out of the car and shut the doors]\nFury: Oh, hold up. You look like somebody's disaffected niece. Put that on.\n[Fury throws a grey baseball cap with SHIELD's logo at Carol]\nCarol: What is this? [gesturing towards the logo]\nFury: It's the SHIELD logo.\nCarol: Does announcing your identity on clothing help with the covert part of your job.\nFury: Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit.\n[Carol puts the cap on, and looks at Fury annoyed]\nFury: Lose the flannel.\n[Carol takes off the flannel shirt hanging around her waist and throws it into the car. Carol and Fury then walk over to the edge of the carpark, showing an airplane hanger full of planes set up similar to that in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. A security guard from Pegasus and two armed airmen approach them from behind]\nSecurity: How can I help you?\nFury: We're agents of SHIELD.\n[Fury hands his badge to the security officer before looking at Fury]\nCarol: We're looking for a woman named Lawson.\nFury: A Dr. Wendy Lawson.\nCarol: Do you know her?\n[The security officer hands back Fury's badge and directs them]\nSecurity: Follow me.\nCarol: Hmm.\n[Carol and Fury follow the security officer but are directed towards a holding facility. The scene cuts to Carol and Fury sitting in an office, both incredibly bored. Fury is leaning forward, placing his elbows on his knees while Carold is leaning back against the wall with her arms crossed.]\nFury: Are you familiar with the phrase \"Welcome Wagon\"?\nCarol: No.\nFury: Well, this ain't it.\n[Fury then tries to leave the room by placing his thumb on a scanner near the door. The scanner looks at his fingerprint before blinking red. Fury then sighs before reaching into his pocket to grab his pager]\nCarol: Is that a communicator?\n[Fury stands up, walk across the room and begins typing on his pager]\nFury: Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.\nCarol: Who are you paging?\nFury: My mom. Don't worry, I didn't mention you.\n[The text on the pager reads \"DETAINED WITH TARGET. NEED BACKUP\"]\n[Carol stands up and walks towards the door and tries opening it with her fingerprint, before walking across the room to look at a map of the facility. At the same time, Fury then takes out his badge and looks at it carefully under the lights. He takes a piece of sticky tape, presses it against his badge before walking across the room and placing it on the scanner. When Fury begins walking across the room, Carol sits on the desk and watches him. The scanner reads the fingerprint before glowing green and opening the door]\nFury: After you.\nCarol: Impressive.\nFury: Oh. You should see what I can do with a paperclip.\n[Carol and Fury walk out of the room. The camera then skips, showing them leaving an elevator on the level holding records. As they are walking towards the records room, Goose walks up to Fury and Carol causing Fury to fawn over the cat]\nFury: Hey, there. How are you?\n[Fury leans down to pet Goose but Carol stands back, observing the cat with a sense of deja vu]\nFury: Oh my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you. Aren't you the cutest little thing.\n[Fury continues to fawn over the cat, even picking up Goose but Carol continues walking through the corridor looking for the records. Carol eventually finds the room before turning around and watching Fury with disinterest]\nFury: Aren't you cute? And what's your name, huh? What's your name? \"Goose\", cool name for a cool cat.\nCarol: Fury.\n[Both Fury and Goose turn to look at Carol. Carol nods towards the door]\nFury (to Goose): I'll be back.\n[Fury walks away from Goose and stands next to Carol outside a door labeled \"Records\"]\nFury: Oh. Let me get my fingerprint out. Just let me unravel this puppy.\n[While Fury is unwrapping the piece of sticky tape, Carol shoots energy out of her fist causing the handle and lock to disappear]\nFury: You sat there and watched me play with tape? When all you had to do was... [Fury imitates Carol shooting the energy]\nCarol: I didn't want to steal your thunder.\n[Carol and Fury walk into the records room. The room is originally dark, but the lights turn on row by row revealing a massive warehouse of shelves full of boxes. Carol and Fury walk past a few aisles before stopping and turning into one. Carol looks at all the boxes carefully before finding the one she wants]\nCarol: Huh. Lawson.\n[Carol pulls two boxes off the shelf. She hands the first to Fury and then places the second on the floor before removing files. Randomly, Goose appears at the end of the aisle]\nCarol: Ha. Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine. I wonder why they terminated the project.\nFury: Um, maybe because she's cuckoo.\n[Fury shows Carol a page from a notebook, covered in hieroglyphics which Carol instantly recognizes]\nCarol: Kree glyphs?\nFury: Hmm?\nCarol: Lawson is not cuckoo. She's Kree.\nFury: Well, she's dead.\nCarol: What?\nFury: She crashed the ASIS aircraft during an unauthorized test flight. Took a pilot down with her. That's why security here's so unfriendly. They're covering up a billion dollar mistake. Oh, and your light-speed engine is toast.\n[Fury shows Carol a black and white photograph of a site of the plane crash. The image is a satellite photo of a flat beach next to a mountain, however, the beach has a track leading up to a circle caused by an explosion. Carol turns over the next photo, showing the beach from eye level; the sand was pushed up into large ridges by the explosion]\nCarol: When did this crash happen?\nFury: Six years ago. 1989.\nCarol: Who was the pilot?\nFury: Um, most of this thing's redacted but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau. Last person to see them both alive.\n[Fury's pager begins to buzz]\nFury: You OK?\nCarol: Mm-hmm.\nFury: Back in a minute.\n[Once Fury's gone, Carol reaches into the pile of file's in Fury's box and reads the testimonial and crash report. While she is flipping through the file, she stops at an image of Dr. Lawson, Maria, a pilot and herself in the background]\n[A flashback then starts. A fighter jet suddenly takes off from a tarmac. Dr. Lawson speaks to Carol and Maria while the two pilots admire the plane]\nLawson: This isn't about fighting wars. It's about ending them.\n[The flashback continues, with Carol attempting to land the new plane but crashing through trees before abruptly finishing]\n[The scene then cuts to Carol on the phone with Yon-Rogg]\nCarol: I know Lawson was Kree. She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash. Do you know anything about this?\nYon-Rogg: I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53. There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you Vers, but... [looks to see no one is looking]\u00a0Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell. She was working on a unique energy core. Experimenting with tech that apparently could help us win the war.\n[Scene suddenly changes to show four or five black sedans racing through the entrance tunnel before abruptly pulling up. The director of SHIELD then steps out of the passenger side door of the first car]\nDirector: Still here?\nFury: She's co-operating with the investigation sir.\nDirector: You men stay here.\n[The director points towards the men in the other cars before himself and Fury walk towards the elevators]\nDirector: I want to question her alone. Excellent work Nicholas.\n[As the Director and Fury step inside the elevator, Fury turns around and looks at the director with a questioning look before the doors close in front of them. The scene then changes back to Carol and Yon-Rogg on the phone]\nCarol: Does it say anything about me?\nYon-Rogg: Anything about you? No, of course not. Why would it?\nCarol: I found evidence that I had a life here.\nYon-Rogg: On C-53?\nCarol: Mar-Vell is who I see in the Supreme Intelligence. I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.\nYon-Rogg: This sounds like Skrull simulation Vers.\nCarol: No its not! 'Cause I remember I was here!\nYon-Rogg: Stop! Remember your training. Know your enemy. It could be you. Do not let your emotions undermine your judgment.\n[Scene changes back to the elevator with Fury and the Director]\nFury: She's on sub-level 6. I'll get off on 5, take the stairs in case she runs for it. Do a pincer move, like we did in Havana.\nDirector: Right. Like we did in Havana.\n[The elevator buzzes and the doors open. Fury steps off and walks away while the Director stays in the elevator. The scene changes back to Carol and Yon-Rogg]\nYon-Rogg: We're nearing the jump-point. Leave your beacon on so I can find you. We'll get to the bottom of this Vers. Together.\nCarol: Ok.\n[Carol then hangs up the phone. The scene then changes to show the Director stepping off the elevator on an abandoned level, probably a boiler room. The director looks around confused before the scene changes to show Fury walking through an aisle of cabinets]\nFury: Vers!... Vers!\n[The lights turn on at the end of the corrdior, showing a SWAT-like team following the director. Fury quickly jumps into a random aisle. The SWAT team then search through every aisle looking for either Fury or Carol. As this is happening, Carol is seen walking down the stairs towards sub-level 6 with Coulsen and another agent on the flight of stairs above her]\nAgent: Fury's colluding with the target.\nCoulsen: Then why did he call us in?\nAgent: All I know is that we take him in too. Dead or alive.\nCoulsen: Dead or alive?\n[Carol, standing directly underneath them hears this conversation and, after a moment of contemplation, decides to turn back around and walk up the stairs to find Fury. Fury is then seen hiding at the end of an aisle of cupboards, peeking his head around one side before throwing an empty can across the room. The lights suddenly turn on and a team of agents runs towards the can. Fury then walks through the aisle, before peering his head around. However, when Fury does this, the director points a gun at his head]\nDirector: Is it something I said?\n[Fury hits the gun away from his head, leading to a long struggle between the two men with the Director being victorious]\nDirector: Now you know, I don't really need these to see (holding up his glasses which were knocked off during the fight). But, they do kinda complete the look (the Director's voice suddenly changes into the voice of Skrull General Talos). Don't you think?\n[During this monologue, the Director advances towards Fury, who is lying on his back in defeat. However, an energy blast suddenly appears blasting straight into his chest and sending him flying backward. Several teams of agents suddenly appear standing near the Director, with their guns drawn. But the camera tilts to show a hole burnt through the roof, and Carol and Fury running along a corridor on the level above]\nCarol: You called them in?\nFury: My bad!\n[Carol and Fury turn a corner, and they are suddenly running up a flight of stairs however, Coulsen is standing direclty above them with his gun drawn. Carol's hand lights up but Coulsen lowers his weapon before letting both of them walk through the door behind them]\nAgent: Coulsen, you have eyes on them? \nCoulsen: They're not down here. Let's try up there.\n[Carol and Fury then sprint out of the corridor before barricading the door behind them with a piece of metal. Carol then holds out her hand, expecting Fury to give her something. When he doesn't, she hits him and holds her hand out again]\nFury: What?\nCarol: Your communicator. You obviously can't be trusted with it.\n[Fury hands over his pager, as the agents slam into the door behind them. The agents are heard struggling, but Carol and Fury run over towards cover. The agents eventually push through, but Carol and Fury are already hidden behind a tower of boxes. Carol then observes her surroundings, looking for a way out before hitting Fury and gesturing towards a plane, which has a striking resemblance to a Star Wars ship. The agents continue to search, even walking past were Carol and Fury were hiding, but the duo are already in the cockpit]\nFury: Do you know how to fly this thing?\nCarol: Uh... we'll see.\nFury: That's a yes or no question.\n[Carol purposefully plays with a few switches, causing the engine to roar to life and the wings to extend]\nCarol: Yes.\n[The Director hears the engine come to life and turns around to see the plane alive. Carol then pushes a lever forward and causes the plane to lift]\nFury: That's what I'm talking about!\n[The Director and the agents shoot meaninglessly at the plane, but the plane continues to lift off and fly normally. Carol flys the plane out of the underground tarmac area, and over the open desert before the plane begins gaining altitude quickly. Suddenly, a meowing sound can be heard from the back of the plane. Both Carol and Fury turn to see Goose pushed against a crate]\nFury: We've got a stowaway.\nGoose: Meooow.\nCarol: Hang on Goose.\n[Carol then stops the plane from gaining altitude and Goose pushes himself off the crate, onto his four legs. Goose then happily walks up to the cockpit before trying to climb into Carol's lap. Carol pick him up and places him on the console before Goose lies down]\nFury: Who's a good kitty huh? Huh Goose? Yes, that's right. Who's a good kitty Goose? You're a good kitty.\n[Goose responds to Fury by lying down comfortably and staring at him]\nCarol: See anyone you know? Funny story... I arrived on Hala, near dead, no memory... That was six years ago.\nFury: So you think you're the pilot that went down with Dr Lawson.\nCarol: I'm saying that the last person to see them alive can probably tell us.\nFury: Maria Rambeau.\nCarol: Mmhmm. So how do we get to Louisianna?\nFury: Due East. Hang a right at Memphis.\nCarol: That agent, that stopped the Skrulls from fighting us...\nFury: Coulsen. New guy. Guess he doesn't hate me yet.\nCarol: Yeah well, give him time.\nFury: I guess he had a feeling, went with his gut against orders. It's a really hard thing to do. That's what keeps us human.\nCarol: I get in trouble for that. A lot.\nFury: I see that about you (Carol and Fury laugh about this). Rescuing the guy how sold you out to the Skrulls. I guess that's not standard Kree operating procedure.\nCarol: Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.\n[The scene then changes to the Kree ship approaching a jump-point. Yon-Rogg is seen walking towards the holograph, which is later shown the be Ronan the Accusor]\nYon-Rogg: Ronan.\nRonan: The Accusors have completed their operation but the greater mission was a failure thanks to your team.\nYon-Rogg: It was a trap. To lure our operative Vers to talk for her kidnapper.\nRonan: Give us the location, we'll take care of the terrorist threat.\nYon-Rogg: By bombing them out of the galaxy. No. We'll handle this.\nRonan: Several Skrulls anywhere is a threat to Kree everywhere. Where are they?\nKorath: They are...\nYon-Rogg: Lost. They are lost, for now. But we will find them.\nRonan: Do so, or we will.\n[Ronan disappear, leaving only Yon-Rogg and Korath]\nYon-Rogg: Maintain the course for C-53.\n[The scene changes to show a traditional suburban house behind a forest of trees. On closer inspection, Maria Rambo is tinkering on a workstation beside a small two-seater plane. Carol approaches Maria carefully, almost unsure of what to say or do. Once Carol speaks, Monica Rambeau quickly exits the plane she was exploring]\nCarol: Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.\nMonica: Aunty Carol? Mom, it's Aunty Carol!\u00a0I knew it, everybody said you were dead but we knew they were lying.\n[Monica jumps off the plane and runs to Carol to hug her. Carol stands awkwardly, unaware of how the child is]\nCarol: I'm not really who you think I am.\n[The scene changes to the inside of the house. Maria and Monica are sitting at a small dining table, Carol is leaning against the counter and Fury is leaning against the wall]\nMaria: That is the craziest shit I have ever heard.\nMonica: Green-transforming aliens? There's no such thing.\nFury: You're absolutely right, young lady. There is no such thing. 'Cause if there were, we would want to keep that to ourselves (Fury looks towards Carol accusingly).\nCarol: You don't believe me.\n[Carol stand up and walks towards the stove, where a pot of unboiled water sits on the stove. She stands next to the stove, with one hand on the kettle and begins heating it up, her hand glowing blue and orange. When this starts, Monica stands up, both fascinated and curious, and walks over to the stove. Quickly, the kettle begins to boil, blowing steam out and making a whistling noise]\nMonica: No way. That's so cool.\nFury: Oh, ho. She can do a lot more than just make tea with those hands.\nMonica: Like what? Show us.\nCarol: Maybe later.\nMonica: I kept all your stuff, I'll go get it.\nCarol (to Fury): You want to give her a hand with that?\nFury: Mmm??\n[Fury then follows Monica off-screen, leaving Carol alone with Maria, who hasn't said a word since the incident with the kettle. Carol walks from behind the counter and sits opposite Maria at the table]\nMaria: You don't remember anything?\nCarol: I see... flashes. Little moments, but I can't tell what's real. If I could just piece together what happened that morning, maybe it'll all make sense?\nMaria: You woke me up, banging on my door at dawn. Your usual move. Back then we had to get up so early, the Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat, so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered. And you wanted to race to base, in your old Mustang, and I wasn't about to argue, 'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate. But you cheated, took a shortcut.\nCarol: Since when is a shortcut cheating?\nMaria: Since it violates the pre-determined rules of engagement.\nCarol: I definitely don't remember those.\nMaria: Mmm, of course you don't (both Maria and Carol laugh for a bit). When I got to the hanger, Lawson was agitated, she said 'she had lives to save'. She was trying to take the Aces up herself, but you said...\nCarol: 'If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane'\nMaria: Yup. Big hero moment. The kind of moment we've both been waiting for. The Doc was always unique. That's why I liked her. But, now you're saying she's from another planet.\nCarol: I know this must be hard for you.\nMaria: What, this part right here? No, no. Know what's hard? Losing my best friend, in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened. Hard... is knowing you were out there somewhere, too damn stubborn to die. And now you come up in here after 6 years... with your super-charged fire-hands and you expect me to call you... I don't even know what... 'Vers'? Is that really who you are now?\nCarol: I don't know.\nMonica: Come look.\n[Monica has brought a box of Carol's things onto the dining table in an adjacent room. Fury looks through a few photos before putting them back and stepping away from the table. Carol walks into the room and stands behind Monica, who is showing her a photo]\nMonica: This is me and you on Halloween.\n[Monica shows Carol a photo of a young Monica dressed as a pilot sitting next to Carol]\nMonica: I'm Amelia Earhart and you're Janis Joplin. Oh, this is you when you were little, you didn't get along with your parents so Mom said we became your real family.\n[Monica shows Carol a photo of a young Carol standing next to her father]\nMonica: This is us on Christmas. I got more...\n[Monica shows Carol photo after photo, starting with Monica, Carol and Maria sitting in front of a Christmas tree, then a photo of young Carol dressed as a pilot, then a photo of Carol sitting in a bar]\nMonica: Here's another picture of when you were little. And this is how you right after you graduated... (Monica continues to talk, but the words start to mix together).\n[The camera pans over all the photos which Monica has shown and is showing to Carol. In addition to the other photos, there is one of her Air Force graduation, one of her squadron standing in front of a plane, one of her and Monica carving a pumpkin and another of Carol dressed as Janis Joplin]\nMonica: Oh wait. I forgot, your jacket. Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore after I spilled ketchup on it.\n[Monica runs off to retrieve Carol's jacket. Once Monica has left, Carol looks at the pictures again, pushing them around to better see ones underneath. Carol continues looking through the pictures before she comes across her old dog tag, which has been burnt]\nMaria: That was all that survived the crash. Or so we thought.\n[The door knocks, and Maria moves forward to answer the door]\nCarol: Don't answer that.\nMaria: It's just my neighbor.\nCarol: They can change into anyone.\n[Fury and Carol walk towards the door and try to see who is outside. Carol answers the door and stares unfriendly at Maria's neighbor, Tom]\nTom: Hi there.\nCarol: What do you want?\nTom: Ummm...\nMaria: Hey Tom. This is my friend Carol.\nTom: Pleased to meet you. Yow! Static electricity out here's no joke. I noted that peculiar bird you got parked by the road, and I was just wondering if you'd mind if I bring the boys over to get a closer looksie?\nCarol: A closer looksie?\nTom: Yeah.\nCarol: To see the bird parked out by the road. You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you Talos?\nMaria: I'm sorry. Tom, this isn't really a good time. I'll come by tomorrow? Okay?\nTom: Uhh...\nMaria: Okay.\n[Maria closes the door, but Carol continues to stare at Tom. Once Maria has closed the door, a voice is heard behind them. Fury draws his weapon and aims it towards the voice, Carol's hands light up and Maria stands there confused]\nTalos: You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors. You never know when you're gonna need to borrow some sugar.\n[Talos takes a sip of the milkshake he is holding while Carol begins to advance towards him, her hands glowing more now]\nTalos: Now, hang on a second, before you go swinging those jazz hands around, making a mess in your friend's house - and... it's a lovely home.\nMaria: Oh my God. What the hell?\n[Maria is staring out the window, looking at herself playing with Monica]\nTalos: No one's gonna hurt the girl. Just, don't kill me. That would really complicate the situation.\nFury: I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.\nTalos: I'm sorry I simmed your boss. But now I stand before you as my true self. Without deception.\nCarol: And who is that, out there?\nTalos: Okay, that's a fair point. But I'm sure that you understand, I had to take some precautions. I saw you crush 20 of my best men with your hands bound. I just wanna talk.\nCarol: Last time we talked, I ended up hanging from my ankles.\nTalos: That was before I knew who you were. Before I found what made you different from the others. I have an audio recording from Pegasus, of your voice, from a plane crash six years ago. On a device I believe you call a 'black box'.\nMaria: They told me it was destroyed in the crash. How'd you get it?\nTalos: Does she not understand? Young lady I have a special skill that kinda allows me to get into places I'm not supposed to be.\nMaria: Call me young lady again, and I'm gonna put my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.\nTalos: Am I supposed to guess where that is?\nFury and Maria: Your ass.\nTalos: Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here. But look, I just need your help decoding some coordinates. If you sit down, you listen to this, I assure you, it'll be worth your while.\nCarol: Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.\nTalos: Deal.\n[Goose walks onto the scene and begins pressing himself against Talos' legs. Talos, surprised jumps backwards]\nTalos: Oh my God! Get that thing away! How'd that get in here?\n[Carol picks up Goose, and holds him out towards Talos. Carol walks towards Talos, with her arms still extended, causing Talos to walk backwards]\nCarol: The cat? This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?\nTalos: That's not a cat. That's a Flerken.\nFury: A Flerken? (Fury laughs)\n[Monica walks into the house and sees Maria standing next to Carol and Fury. She looks around and sees the Skrull assuming its true form]\nMonica: Mom?\n[The scene changes to the outside of a barn, with Monica sitting outside on the bench and Maria trying to stop her from coming inside]\nMonica: Why can't I listen to?\n[Monica puts earplugs in her ears and Maria walks inside, revealing a study. Carol, Fury, and Talos are already inside, waiting for Maria to play the tape. Maria puts the CD in the computer tower and the computer begins loading the tape. A loading bar appears on the screen, with the bar moving slowly across the screen]\nCarol: What's happening?\nFury: It's loading.\n[The camera cuts back to the screen, with the tape almost loaded]\nLawson (audio): Punch in the coordinates. 5229,. -47, 8.768, 0.2.\nCarol (audio): Copy that. Where are we going Doc?\nLawson (audio):  My laboratory.\nCarol (audio): Your laboratory? What do you mean?\nLawson (audio): Oh no.\nCarol (audio): Is that... Wait, what is that? It's not showing up on my radar.\nLawson (audio): Go Carol. Fly!\n[Scene changes to a flashback of the inside the airplane, with Carol in the cockpit and Lawson directly behind her. Outside the window, Earth can be seen with other planes flying around it]\nCarol: That's no MIG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?\nLawson: Those are the bad guys. Fly faster, now.\nCarol: Yes, ma'am. (Carol pushes a lever forward, causing the plane to speed up. The plane following them als also speeds up to catch them. The dogfight between the two planes continue, with Carol pushing the lever sideways in an effort to escape the other plane) What do they want?\nLawson: Me. My work. I never should have brought you along.\nCarol: Here come some G's. (Carol pulls the lever backwards, causing the plane to flip in the air. After the flip, Carol and Lawson are trailing the other plane. However, when Carol fires the other plane fires back). They're firing backward. Hold on! (Carol pushes the lever sideways and the plane tilts into another revolution. However, the plane is hit and the wing bursts into flames. Carol struggles to regain control of the plane, but fails to do so]\nCarol: Bail out! Bail out! Bail out! Stay with me Lawson! (Carol ejects the cockpit from the plane, and struggles to regain control. Once Carol has aligned the plane parallel to the ground, the plane crashes into a beach)\nMaria: Danvers, do you copy?\nCarol: Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.\nMaria: Can anyone hear\u00a0me?\nCarol: Yeah. I copy! Doc?\n[Carol climbs out of the plane and attends to Lawson, whose head is slumped against her chest. Once Carol removes Lawson's helmet, she notices something is wrong]\nCarol: Your blood... it's blue.\nLawson: Yeah, but, uh...how's my hair? Help me out.\n[Carol unbuckles Lawson's seatbelt and helps her out of the plane]\nLawson: I have to destroy it before they get here.\n[Carol helps Lawson walk a few steps away from the plane before Lawson falls over. Carol leans over Lawson and tries to help her stand up, but Lawson refuses]\nCarol: What? Lawson?\nLawson: You remember what I said about our work here? What it's for?\nCarol: To end wars?\nLawson: Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know. Damn it! My name is not Lawson. My real name, is Mar-Vell and I come from a planet called Hala.\nCarol: I would say that your delusional but we just got shot down by a spaceship and your blood is blue.\nLawson: Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war. Now skedaddle before you give me any more regrets. Just remember the coordinates, okay? You've got to save them without me.\nCarol: Save who? How?\n[Lawson ignores Carol's questions and pulls a gun out of her jacket]\nLawson: I've got to blow this engine before they find it.\n[Lawson sits up and attempts to shoot the plane, but she is shot through the heart by an attacker from the other ship. Carol watches Lawson fall and sits there in shot watching the assailant. Suddenly, Carol reaches for Lawson's gun and points in the direction of the attacker. Carol switches between looking at Lawson lying on the ground and the direction of the attacker. Eventually, Yon-Rogg appears walking towards Carol and Lawson. Carol, with her gun drawn, slowly walks towards the plane]\nYon-Rogg: We have no interest in hurting you.\nCarol: No?! Because all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!\nYon-Rogg: The energy core, where is it?\nCarol: Pararescue's on the way. You have two minutes until you're surrounded.\nYon-Rogg: Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.\n[Yon-Rogg draws his gun and points it towards Carol]\nCarol: No wait. (Carol gestures towards the engine of the plane) You mean that energy core?\n[Both Carol and Yon-Rogg look at the engine of the plane. Carol then turns her weapon towards the engine and fires. Immediately, the engine bursts into blue and orange flames, causing Carol and Yon-Rogg to be thrown backward. Carol absorbs the energy, with the flames creating ripples around her. All around the crash site, rocks are turned into dust and trees disintigrate. Carol continues to absorb the energy, her hands begin to spark and her eyes glow bright blue. Shortly afterwards, the blast suddenly stops and Carol is thrown backward onto the ground, with her body still sparking. Yon-Rogg struggles to stand up, and watches Carol from his seated position. Yon-Rogg's team heard the noise and have suddenly appeared]\nMinn-Erva: Commander, she's still moving. Permission to fire?\nYon-Rogg: Hold your fire.\n[Yon-Rogg walks up to the still-sparking Carol]\nMinn-Erva: There's nothing left. The core has been destroyed.\n[Yon-Rogg continues looking at Carol, but notices a part of her dog-tag sitting in the dirt. He picks it up and sees \"Vers\" inscribed on it]\nYon-Rogg: She absorbed its power. She's coming with us.\n[The scene suddenly changes back into the present day, outside of the study. Carol is walking outside, confused]\nCarol: He lied to me.\n[Maria, Fury, and Talos follow her outside slowly]\nCarol: Everything that I knew was a lie.\nTalos: Now you understand.\nCarol: What? What do I understand now?\nTalos: Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell. He killed her. Because she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.\nCarol: No. Your people are terrorists... that kill innocents. I saw the ruins on Torfa.\nTalos: Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for. My people lived as refugees on Torfa. Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule and they destroyed our planet. Now the handful of us that are left, will be slaughtered next...unless you will help me finish what Mar-Vell started. The coordinates you found, would've powered a lightspeed ship capable of carrying us to safety. A new home, where the Kree can't reach us.\nMaria: Lawson always told us that her work at Pegasus wasn't to fight wars, but to end them.\nTalos: She wanted you to help us find the core.\nCarol: Well, I already destroyed it.\nTalos: No, you destroyed the engine. The core that powered it is in a remote location. If you help us decode those coordinates, we can find it.\nCarol: You'll use it to destroy us.\nTalos: We just want a home. You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree. Can't you see it now? You're not one of them.\nCarol: You don't know me. You have no idea who I am. I don't even know who I am!\nMaria:\u00a0You are Carol Danvers. You are the woman on that black box risking her life to do the right thing. My best friend... who supported me as a mother, and a pilot when no one else did. You're smart and funny, and a huge pain in the ass. And you are the most powerful person I knew, way before you could shoot fire from your fist. You hear me? You hear me?\n[The scene changes back to the inside of the barn, with Talos, a Skrull scientist, Fury, Carol and Maria standing around a table]\nTalos: I know I don't deserve your trust but you were our only lead. We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar-Vell's core. Now, we know why. If only you knew, the importance of it to me. I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.\nCarol: Those weren't coordinates. They're safe vectors.\nFury: Orbital positioning and velocity.\nMaria: You didn't find her lab on Earth, because it's not on Earth.\nCarol: That was the location on the day of the crash six years ago. If we track its course, we'll find it, in orbit, right now.\nMaria: It's just basic physics.\nTalos: In orbit? Was that so difficult to figure out? I mean, you're my science guy, right?\n[The Skrull scientists nods then looks down briefly, disappointed in himself]\nCarol: Yon-Rogg will catch up to you soon. We've got to get the core before he does.\nFury (while eating a sandwich): Mmm. You're going to space?\nCarol: In what?\nSkrull Scientist: A few tweaks to your vessel should do it. I can handle the modifications.\nFury: Hmm. Your science guy.\n[The scene changes to the inside of the hanger, with Talos and the Skrull scientist modifying the plane which Carol and Fury flew. The scene then changes back to the inside of the house, with Carol and Maria sitting opposite each other at a table]\nCarol: Well, I could use a co-pilot.\nMaria: No. No, I... I can't. I can't leave Monica.\nMonica: Why? It's okay. I can stay with grandma and pop-pop.\nMaria: There's no way I'm going baby. It's too dangerous.\nMonica: Testing brand new aerospace tech is dangerous. Didn't you used to do that?\n[Carol looks at Maria, smiling smuggly]\nMaria: Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey, and you anticipate hostile encounters with a technologically superior foreign enemy. Correct?\n[Carol smiles and shrugs her shoulders.]\nMonica: That's what I'm saying. You have to go.\nMaria: Monica...\nMonica: You have the chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions. And you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me? I just think that you should consider the kind of example you're setting for your daughter.\n[Maria looks towards Carol for help, but Carol is laughing at Maria's position. Carol then gives Monica a thumbs up]\n[The scene then changes to the outside of the house, with Maria walking towards a car, with her parents inside. Monica sits on the front step watching the encounter. Carol then walks outside with her Kree suit on and sits beside Monica]\nCarol: Your Mom's lucky. When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one. Lieutenant Trouble.\nMonica: You remember.\nCarol: Is that mine? (Carol looks at the jacket sitting in Monica's lap. However, Carol protests when Monica attempts to hand it over). No, no. You hang onto it until I come back. But there is something that I need your help with. I can't wear these Kree colors anymore, and since you're obviously the only person around here with any sense of style...\n[Carol stands up and presses a few buttons on her suit. Carol holds her arm out to Monica, allowing her to change the colors. She replaces the green with bright red and the yellow replacing the grey stripes]\nMonica: No.\n[Monica presses the buttons again. This time, the suit changes to orange, blue and yellow]\nMonica: Uh-uh.\n[Monica presses the buttons again. This time, the suit changes to black with neon lights lining the stripes]\nMonica: Definitely not. (Both Carol and Monica laugh)\n[Monica changes the color again, this time to a white suit with green stripes]\nCarol: Well, since we're on the same team...\n[Carol gestures to Monica's red, yellow and blue shirt. Monica then changes the colors to match her shirt. Carol's suit changes to a blue suit with yellow stripes and red gloves, boots, belt and shoulders]\nCarol:\u00a0How do I look?\nMonica: Fresh.\n[The scene then changes to a path surrounded by grass. Almost immediately, Yon-Rogg steps onto the path and walks down it. He walks down the path and into a small house in the middle of the forest. Carol, in her Kree colors, is already standing inside and watches him enter]\nCarol: What took you so long?\nYon-Rogg: I'm fine. Thanks for asking.\nCarol: PRY46-B...\nYon-Rogg: No, no codes. That system is fallible, as we've learned.\nCarol: Okay, then let's do this.\nYon-Rogg: Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?\nCarol: The person you most admire and respect, I guess. But you would never tell me who.\nYon-Rogg: And what is your earliest memory of Hala?\nCarol: The transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins.\nYon-Rogg: Whose blood?\nCarol: (Carol looks sideways, confused and stumbed) Hmm.\n[Yon-Rogg shoots Carol, causing her to fly backward. Yon-Rogg then walks up to her and points his gun at her face]\nYon-Rogg: That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.\n[Carol suddenly turns into a Skrull]\nYon-Rogg: What have you done with her?\nSkrull: You're too late.\n[Yon-Rogg begins walking away before stopping and turning around]\nYon-Rogg: She knows?\n[Before the Skrull can answer, Yon-Rogg shoots him. He puts his gun back in its holster before calling Ronan with the hologram in his arm]\nYon-Rogg: Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53. Come at once.\nRonan: For the good of all Kree, Commander the infestation will be eradicated.\n[The scene changes to the modified spaceship flying above the clouds before cutting to show Carol and Maria flying. The camera pans out to show Fury petting Goose and Talos looking at him uncomfortably]\nCarol: Passing 500 and climbing.\nTalos: You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.\nFury: Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best. And as long as he continues to freak you out (Fury picks up Goose and shoves him towards Talos' face. Talos jerks backward in his seat) like that, yeah I'm gonna keep giving him all the love and hugs he needs, right?\nMaria: Can I ask you something? Do you just turn into anything you want?\nTalos: Ah well, I have to see it first.\nMaria: Can you all do it?\nTalos: Physiologically, yeah. But it takes practice and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.\nFury: Can you turn into a cat?\nTalos: What's a cat?\nMaria: What about a filing cabinet?\nTalos: Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?\nFury: A venus fly trap. I'll give you $50 right now if you turn into a venus fly trap.\n(Talos sighs, annoyed at Fury's jokes)\nCarol: Switching engines from Scramjet to fusion. Buckle up, folks.\n[Carol pushes down a lever, causing the plane to suddenly climb further into the sky. In the plane, everybody is pushed back into their seats]\nFury: Hey. Is this normal, like space turbulence?\nCarol: Pretty much.\n[Carol smiles at Fury's question, while Talos just looks towards him and shakes his head. The plane continues to fly directly upwards, inside the plane everything begins floating. Carol and Maria's hair begins floating along with a few pens from the console between their seats. Similarly, Goose is floating upside down until Fury extends his arm, which Goose eagerly grabs onto. Maria then flicks a switch and gravity suddenly turns on inside the plane, and everything returns to normal]\nCarol: Locking in coordinate grid.\nMaria: Where is it?\n[The view switches to the outside of the ship, showing the ship sitting in empty space with Earth below it]\nTalos: It's here. It's gotta be here.\nFury: Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?\n[Carol realizes something and pulls out the computer in her arm. After a few swipes, the computer lights up]\nComputer: Decloaking activated.\n[Suddenly, a bright light appears from the empty space and a massive laboratory becomes visible. The title \"Mar-Vell's Laboratory, Kree Imperial Cruiser\" appears on the screen. Carol flies the spaceship into the laboratory and the four disembark the plane and begin walking through the corridors]\n[The four walk into a giant room, with the Tesseract sitting in the reactor on one side of the room. Goose jumps onto the reactor and scratches the Tesseract, intrigued by the bright light. Carol and Maria follow behind him]\nMaria: Is that it? The core?\nCarol: In her notes, she called it the Tesseract.\n[Carol reaches out and grabs the Tesseract from its position in the reactor. She then throws it in the air like a baseball and walks around the room, beginning to observe her surroundings]\nMaria: Whoa. What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?\n[Maria picks up and lunchbox and opens it. Carol then places the Tesseract inside before closing the box. Fury then coughs and gestures towards a cup of tea, which is still steaming]\nMaria: We're not alone.\n[Talos begins singing loudly. Suddenly, a swarm of scared Skrlls appear from their hiding places. Suddenly a Skrull runs towards Talos and hugs himi]\nSoren: Talos!\nCarol: He didn't come here for the Tesseract.\n[Soren calls a child to come towards her and Talos. The child comes willingly, and Talos leans down to get a better look at him]\nSoren: It's okay. We didn't know what to do. Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason or the Kree would find us.\nTalos: You did the right thing.\n[Once Soren noticed that Carol, Maria, and Fury are standing in the room, she tries to back away but Talos stops her]\nTalos: It's okay, it's okay. She's alright. She's a friend.\nCarol: I'm not gonna hurt you.\nTalos: She led me to you.\nCarol: I'm so sorry. I didn't know.\nTalos: Carol, this is war. My hands are filthy from it too. But we're here now. You found my family. This is just the beginning. There's thousands of us separated from each other...scattered throughout the galaxy.\n[Talos' daughter walks over to Carol, holds her hand and directs her towards the pinball machine in the corner. When they get there, the child points to the high score in glowing lights. The child jumps excitedly and asks her to play]\nFury: If I played the same pinball machine for six years I'd have some high scores too.\n[Suddenly the doors to the lab open, and Yon-Rogg and his team walk through]\nYon-Rogg: Fraternizing with the enemy?\n[Fury draws his gun but Minn-Erva already has hers pointed directly towards him. When she gestures for him to drop it, he raises his hands in surrender and returns the gun to its holster. Yon-Rogg walks towards Carol and throws Goose along the floor towards her. When the camera pans, Talos has positioned Soren behind her, Fury and Maria are both unarmed and the Kree's have surrounded the four]\nYon-Rogg: What did you do to your uniform?\nMinn-Erva: They got in her head. Just like we thought.\nKorath: The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.\nTalos: You can see they're not soldiers, let them go. You can have me.\nYon-Rogg: And the core?\nCarol: You lied to me.\nYon-Rogg: I made you a better version of yourself. What's given can be taken away.\n[Carol tries to light up her fists but they just spark uselessly before eventually dying out. The chip in her neck has also turned off. Instead of using her powers, Carol runs towards Yon-Rog and begins punching him. This results in a fist fight between the two. Quickly, Yon-Rogg lights up a gadget in his suit. The gadget glowed bright blue and caused Carol to lean back in an attempt to avoid it. Around her, the Kree are attacking the Skrulls, forcing them to kneel. Yon-Rogg then jerks his arm away from Carol, causing her to fall onto the ground]\n[When Carol wakes up, the Supreme Intelligence machine is attached to her. She is kneeling with her hands bound in front of her. When Carol meets the Supreme Intelligence, a record is playing beside her and a long table is sitting in front of her, a few meters away with Dr. Lawson sitting at the only seat]\nLawson: There she is. Seems like you time on C-53 jogged the old memory. This jacket? It's killer by the way.\n[Lawson stands up and begins dancing to the music]\nLawson: The music, it's a nice touch.\nCarol: Let... me... out.\nLawson: No can do.\nCarol: If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.\nLawson: With what exactly? Your powers came from us.\nCarol: You didn't give me these powers. The blast did.\nLawson: And yet, you've never had the strength to control them on your own.\n[Carol tries to blast Lawson with her energy blast, but when she tries Lawson snaps her finger and the energy dissapears, replaced with searing pain in Carol's neck which causes Carol to double over in pain]\n[The scene switches back to the spaceship. The Kree are still surrounding the Skrulls, and Goose is being scanned with a Kree scanner]\nScanner: Species: Flerken. Threat: High.\n[Bron-Char begins putting a muzzle on Goose's head, but is met by protests from Fury]\nFury: It's a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter.\nScanner: Species: Human male. Threat: Low to none.\nFury: That thing is clearly busted.\nMinn-Erva: Load the Flerken onto the heli. Eject the others into space.\n[The scene switches back to inside the Supreme Intelligence. Carol has just finished standing up after the pain in her neck]\nLawson: You did good, ace. Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more.\nCarol: I used to believe your lies. But the Skrulls are just fighting for a home. You're talking about destroying them because they won't submit to your rule. And neither will I.\nLawson: We found you. We embraced you as our own.\nCarol: You stole me. From my home, my family, my friends.\n[Carol runs forward and jumps to punch Lawson, however, her hand travels right through Lawson's skull. Lawson then throws Carol into a wall, leaving Carol hanging sideways]\nLawson: It's cute how hard you try. Remember... without us...you're weak. (Carol pushes herself behind the wall, and sees a screen of her younger memories on Earth playing) You're flawed. Helpless. We saved you.\n[The screen of Carol's failures continues to play, until she suddenly drops, falling into nothingness until suddenly landing on the floor]\nLawson: Without us... you're only human.\nCarol: You're right. I'm only human.\n[Suddenly a montage plays, of Carol standing up everytime after her failures]\nLawson: On Hala, you were reborn. Vers.\nCarol: My name... is Carol.\n[Carol lights up her fist, but Lawson blasts energy towards her first. Lawson's energy surrounds Carol, but Carol manages to walk towards Lawson. On the spaceship, Carol's hands begin to light up and begin burning the machine]\nKorath: She's trying to break out.\n[Carol continues to release energy waves from her hands. This causes all electricity on the ship to malfunction. Goose's cage comes loose, the prisoner's handcuffs suddenly pop open and the cage full of Skrulls is opened]\nCarol: I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back. But what happens when (Carol pulls out\u00a0the chip attached to her neck, causing the energy from her fists to spread to cover her entire body) I'm finally set free?\n[Carol drops the chip before flashing back to her absorbing the energy from the explosion before flashing back to the present day where the chip explodes off her\u00a0neck like a bullet and she is released from the Supreme Intelligence, glowing and floating in the air. She suddenly blasts energy from her hands, and sends four Kree flying backward in to the wall behind them. She grabs the lunchbox with the Tesseract and finds Maria and Fury]\nFury: You know you're glowing, right?\nCarol: I'll explain it later. (Carol opens the lunchbox to reveal the Tesseract glowing inside) Take the Tesseract, leaving the lunchbox.\nFury: (Fury has just unbuckled Goose's collar and is now holding him) Me?\nCarol: Yes.\nFury: I'm not touching that thing.\nCarol: Want me to get you an oven mitt?\n[Goose suddenly lurches himself out of Fury's arms and giant tentacles emerge from inside Goose's mouth. Goose picks up the Tesseract from the lunchbox and swallows it whole before returning back to a normal cat. Fury quickly drops Goose in surprise]\nCarol: Get the Skrulls in the QuadJet and go. Take the Flerken with you.\nMaria: What about you?\nCarol: I'll buy you some time!\nFury: I'm picking you up now. I'm trusting you not to eat me.\n[Carol is then seen sitting on the railing of an overhead corrider. She holds up the lunchbox in front of her before jumping over the railing once she has the Kree's attention]\nCarol: Hey Guys. Arm-wrestle for the Tesseract.\nYon-Rogg: I used to find you amusing. Let's put an end to this!\n[The Kree all draw their weapon and begin to advance on her. Carol simply blasts her energy down the overpass, causing the metal to snap and four Kree to be incapacitated. Carol then proceeds to take on the Kree, attacking them individually. Each fight only lasts a few seconds, but always results in Carol dominating]\n[Maria picks up a gun and fires until Goose opens his mouth and the tentacles take the kree soldiers, beat them up and swallowed them]\nMaria:\u00a0Okay.\nFury:\u00a0Good .\nCarol: You knew all along. Is that why we never hung out?\nMinn-Erva: No. I just never liked you.\n[The scene changes to Fury and Maria running through a corridor on the ship. Suddenly, a group of Kree appears behind them]\nKree: Hey! In a hurry?\n[Scene changes back to the fight between Yon-Rogg and Carol. Yon-Rogg is standing above Carol, about to attack her]\nYon-Rogg: Don't make me do this.\nCarol: Okay.\n[Carol then blasts some energy, causing her to fly upwards and Yon-Rogg to fly backward towards a wall]\nFury: Now! Come on! Do your thing. Come on! Dammit, Goose. Pick a side.\nKree: Take them to the hangar too. We'll blast them all into space.\nTalos: Play it cool. Just like Havana. Do you have the thing?\nFury: Flerken kitty ate it.\nKree: Come on. Move. Move!\nTalos: Follow my lead. Cover her eyes (to Soren). \n[Talos then shoots the four guards escorting the Skrulls onto the ship, causing a distraction]\nTalos: Get on the ship. Let's go, let's go.\n[The fighting between Yon-Rogg and Carol continues. Eventually, Yon-Rogg pins Carol to the wall with a mountain of metal from the walkway. He then opens the lunchbox to find a soup container sitting inside]\nYon-Rogg: Nice diversion.\nCarol: I could've swore, I put it in there.\n[The fighting between Carol and Yon-Rogg restarts with Yon-Rogg throwing loose pieces of metal at Carol telepathically. Carol quickly escapes and runs towards the energy source. However, the Kree found the Skrulls had begun escaping and ran towards the hanger, shooting randomly at the ship. One of these bullets hits Talos, causing him to fall over in pain]\n1:28:28\n"

What a bunch of losers. All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to nothing at all. Pathetic.

[referring to the small Xandarian child getting help whilst walking] What is this thing? Look how it thinks it\u2019s so cool. It\u2019s not cool to get help! Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.

The orb. [he holds out the orb and places it on the counter in front of the Broker] As commissioned.\nThe Broker: Where\u2019s Yondu?\nPeter Quill: Wanted to be here, sends his love. And told me to tell you, that you got the best eyebrows in the business. [the Broker picks up the orb] What is it?\nThe Broker: It\u2019s my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.\nPeter Quill: Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.\nThe Broker: An occupational hazard, I\u2019m sure, in your line of work.\nPeter Quill: Some machine-headed freak, working for a dude named Ronan. [the Broker suddenly looks afraid]\nThe Broker: Ronan? I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Quill. I truly am. But I want no part of this transaction if Ronan is involved. [he gives the orb back to Peter and starts pushing him towards his shop door]\nPeter Quill: Woh! Woh, woh, woh! Who\u2019s Ronan?\nThe Broker: A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty, who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture, is wiped from existence! [the Brokers starts pushing Peter again]\nPeter Quill: Woh. Come on!\nThe Broker: He\u2019s someone whose bad side I\u2019d rather not be on.\nPeter Quill: What? What about my bad side? [the Broker opens his shop door and pushes Peter out]\nThe Broker: Farewell, Mr. Quill. [he closes the door in Peter\u2019s face]\nPeter Quill: [shouting to the Broker through his closed shop door] Hey, we had a deal, bro! [as he steps back he notices Gamora standing nearby watching him]\nGamora: What happened?\nPeter Quill: Uh...this guy just backed out of a deal on me. If there's one thing I hate, it's a man without integrity. Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.\nGamora: You have the bearing of a man of honor. [Peter starts to playfully throw the orb up and down in his hand]\nPeter Quill: Well, you know, I wouldn't say that. People say it about me, all the time, but it's not something I would ever say about myself. [suddenly Gamora grabs the orb, kicks Peter in his stomach and runs off, Peter throws something like a magnetic rope which catches around Gamora's legs and trips her up, as she gets the rope off her legs Peter catches up to her but Gamora manages to kick him off and starts punching him, she holds up her knife ready to stab him]\nGamora: This wasn't the plan. [as she's about to stab Peter, Rocket jumps on to her and knocks her down; to Groot referring to Peter]\nRocket: Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag! [Groot extends his roots and goes to grab Gamora] No! Not her, him! Learn genders, man. [as he struggles with Gamora she tries to bite him] Biting? That's not fair! [as Rocket is fighting with Gamora, Peter uses this opportunity to grab the orb and runs off] [as Rocket struggles to hold Gamora] Take it easy! [Gamora manages to free herself from Rocket and Groot's clutches, she throws Rockets aside, picks up a piece of metal, throws it at Peter's hand making him drop the orb, she grabs and as she runs off Peter jumps on to her and knocks her down but Gamora overpowers him again and hold Peter down]\nGamora: Fool. You should have learned.\nPeter Quill: I don't learn. One of my issues. [Peter grabs the orb from her hand, attaches small rocket launcher on Gamora and sets it off throwing Gamora aside, thinking he's in the clear suddenly Groot places a bag over Peter's head] What the... [Groot starts carrying Peter in the bag over his shoulder]\nRocket: Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional. [just then he sees Gamora coming towards them] You gotta be kidding me. [she pushes Rocket aside] Hey! [Gamora fights with Groot, cutting off his arms, as she opens the bag Peter suddenly uses his gun to electrocute her and runs off, Rocket gets out his gun and aims it at Peter] I live for the simple things. Like how much this is gonna hurt. [he shoots his gun which shoots a ball of electricity at Peter giving him an electric shock] Yeah. Writhe, little man. [he looks at Groot who is looking sadly as his severed arms] It'll grow back, you D'ast idiot. Quit whining. [just then they are captured by The Nova Corps]\nNova Arresting Pilot: Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.\nRocket: Oh, crap. [Rockets reluctantly drops his weapon]\nNova Arresting Pilot: By the authority of the Nova Corps, you are under arrest... [at the same time Peter is being arrested]\nCorpsman Dey: Alright. Come on up.\nNova Arresting Pilot: ...for endangerment to life and the destruction of property. [as Dey arrests Peter he recognizes him]\nCorpsman Dey: Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.\nPeter Quill: Star-Lord.\nCorpsman Dey: Oh, sorry. Lord. [to his partner] I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft. He's got a code name.\nPeter Quill: Come on, man. It's a...it's an outlaw name.\nCorpsman Dey: Just relax, pal. It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird. [referring to the Nova Corps]\nRocket: Fascists. [we see as Rocket, Groot and an unconscious Gamora are arrested]\n\n\n[at Nova Headquarters, Xandar\u2019s Armed Forces, Nova Prime is on call to the Kree Ambassador]\nNova Prime: Ronan is destroying Xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy. I should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the Kree.\nKree Ambassador: We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime. What more do you want?\nNova Prime: At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions. He is slaughtering children, families.\nKree Ambassador: That is your business. Now, I have other matters to attend to. [he ends the call]\nNova Prime: Prick.\nDenarian Saal: Well, some good news. Looks like we\u2019ve apprehended one of Ronan\u2019s compatriots. [after all four have been captured and taken to Nova Headquarters, Dey presents each of them to Saal]\nCorpsman Dey: Gamora. Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon. The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos. Recently, Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan, which leads us to believe that Thanos and Ronan are working together. [next it\u2019s Rocket] Subject 89P13. Calls itself Rocket. The result of illegal genetic and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form. [referring to Groot]\nDenarian Saal: What the hell?\nCorpsman Dey: They call it Groot. A humanoid plant that\u2019s been traveling recently as 89P13\u2019s personal house plant slash muscle. [next up is Peter] Peter Jason Quill, from Terra. Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers, led by Yondu Udonta.\nPeter Quill: [Quill winds up his middle finger and flips the bird at them] Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know how this machine worked.\nDenarian Saal: What a bunch of a-holes. [Dey smiles] Transport all four to the Kyln.\n\n\n Incomplete \n[as the four of them are taken to The Kyln, High Security Prison]\nRocket: I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws, but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel. But, hey, that's not my problem. I ain't gonna be here long. I've escaped 22 prisons, this one's no different. You're lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot would be collecting that bounty right now, and you'd be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.\nPeter Quill: I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years. I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon.\nPrison Guard: Hold.\nRocket: What's a raccoon?\nPeter Quill: \"What's a raccoon?\" It's what you are, stupid.\nRocket: Ain't no thing like me, except me. [as they are being led to their cell]\nPeter Quill: So, this orb has a real shiny blue suitcase, Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe. What is it?\nGroot: I am Groot.\nPeter Quill: So what? What's the Orb?\nGamora: I have no words for an honorless thief.\nRocket: Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac. [Gamora looks at Rocket] Yeah, I know who you are. Anyone who's anyone knows who you are.\nPeter Quill: Yeah, we know who you are. [to Groot] Who is she? (Groot: I am Groot.) Yeah, you said that.\nGamora: I wasn't retrieving the orb for Ronan, I was betraying him. I had an agreement to sell it to a third party.\nGroot: I am Groot.\nPeter Quill: Well, that\u2019s just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told that. What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?\nRocket: Well, he don\u2019t know talking good like me and you. So his vocabulistics is limited to \u201cI\u201d and \u201cam\u201d and \u201cGroot\u201d. Exclusively in that order.\nPeter Quill: I tell you what, that\u2019s gonna wear real thin, real fast. [Peter sees a Prison Guard with his Walkman headphones] Hey. Put that away. [he walks inside the room towards the Guard as the door closes] Hey! Listen to me you big blue bastard, take\u00a0those headphones off, that's mine. Those belong to impound, that tape and that player is mine! [the guard stuns Peter with a stun baton] Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973, that song belongs to me! [the guard\u00a0stuns him again, as Hooked on a Feeling starts playing, the guards stuns Peter again\u00a0''as the camera pans offscreen.]\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[MISSING]\nThis article is a stub. You can help Transcripts Wiki by  expanding it.\n\nI have a plan! I have a plan!\nDrax: Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.\nPeter Quill: Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one.\nDrax: Do not ever call me a thesaurus.\nPeter Quill: It's just a metaphor, dude.\nRocket: His people are completely literal, metaphors are gonna go over his head.\nDrax: Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.\nGamora: I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy. [as the prison guards surround the watchtower carrying large weapons]\nPeter Quill: Those are some big guns.\nHead Riot Guard: [to the guards] On my command! Number one! [one of the guards shoots his weapon which hits one of the watchtower glass windows]\nGamora: Rodent, we are ready for your plan.\nRocket: Hold on!\nHead Riot Guard: Number two! [another guard shoots his weapon which hits the other side of the watchtower; referring to Rocket]\nDrax: I recognize this animal. We'd roast them over a flame pit as children. Their flesh was quite delicious.\nRocket: Not helping!\nHead Riot Guard: [to the guards] Number three! [another shoots their weapon which hits another glass window of the watchtower leaving a massive crack] All fire on my command! [Rocket works as fast as he can to save them] Three! Two! One! [just then Rocket rigs to turn off the gravity making everyone in the prison start floating]\nGamora: You turned off the artificial gravity, everywhere but in here.\nRocket: I told you I had a plan. [Rocket disconnects the watchtower from its base, then uses the security droids to attack to the base of it and uses the droids jets to fly the watchtower out of the prison]\nPeter Quill: That was a pretty good plan. [they get out of the watchtower, the others go grab their personal stuff and Peter looks for his spaceship] Yeah! There it is. Get my ship. It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.\nRocket: They crumpled my pants up into a ball. That's rude! They folded yours. [Peter then gets his personal stuff and looks through it, we see the orb on one of his bags]\nGamora: The orb's there. Let's go!\nPeter Quill: Wait, wait, wait. [Peter keeps searching for his Walkman in his stuff]\nGamora: What?\nPeter Quill: That bastard didn't put it back.\nGamora: Put what back? [Peter gives the bag containing the orb to Gamora]\nPeter Quill: Here. Get them to the ship, I will be right back.\nGamora: How are you gonna possibly...\nPeter Quill: Just keep the Milano close by. Go. Go! [Peter runs off] [Peter attacks the prison guards using his weapon taking each one down one by one]\nPrison Guard: Ow! My neck! [Peter shoots him again as he walks past him, at the same time the others have boarded the Milano and are waiting for Peter]\nRocket: Well, how's he gonna get to us?\nGamora: He declined to share that information with me.\nRocket: Well, screw this, then! I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish. You got the orb, right?\nGamora: Yes. [Gamora looks in the bag that Peter gave her and finds the orb is missing, we see Peter has kept the orb and is throwing it up and down in his hand as he goes to get his Walkman from the guard that took it, he uses the orb to bash the guard over the head; back on the Milano]\nRocket: If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.\nGamora: No! We're not leaving without the orb. [just then Drax notices Peter flying towards them]\nDrax: Behold. [as they help Peter board onto the Milano] This one shows spirit. He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan. [to Peter] Companion, what were you retrieving? [Peter gives him the Walkman] You're an imbecile. [as they are flying off in the Milano, Peter finds Rocket taking apart parts of the ship]\nPeter Quill: Woh, woh, woh! Yoh, Ranger Rick! What are you doing? You can't take apart my ship without asking me! See, what is this?\nRocket: Don't touch that, it's a bomb.\nPeter Quill: A bomb?\nRocket: Yep.\nPeter Quill: And you leave it lying around?\nRocket: I was gonna put it in a box.\nPeter Quill: What's a box gonna do? [Rocket pulls out a box and takes out the wrapped present Peter's mother had given him before she had died]\nRocket: How about this one?\nPeter Quill: No! Woh! Hey! Hey! Leave it alone!\nRocket: Why? What is it?\nPeter Quill: Shut up.\nRocket: Hey! [pointing to something else Rocket had pulled out of the ship]\nPeter Quill: What is that?\nRocket: That's for if things get really hardcore. Or if you wanna blow up moons.\nGamora: No one's blowing up moons.\nRocket: You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.\nPeter Quill: So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.\nGamora: We're heading in the right direction, for now. [Gamora picks up the orb]\nPeter Quill: If we're gonna work together, you might want to try trusting me a little bit.\nGamora: And how much do you trust me? [he takes the orb out of Gamora's hand]\nPeter Quill: I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was. Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.\nGamora: I don't know what it is. [Peter places the orb on the table and Drax picks it up]\nDrax: If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.\nGamora: Put it down, you fool! You'll destroy us all.\nDrax: Or just you, murderess!\nGamora: I let you live once, princess!\nDrax: I am not a princess!\nPeter Quill: Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We're stuck together until we get the money. [Drax throws the orb to Peter]\nDrax: If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.\nGamora: Put it down, you fool! You'll destroy us all.\nDrax: Or just you, murderess!\nGamora: I let you live once, princess!\nDrax: I am not a princess!\nPeter Quill: Hey! Nobody is killing anybody on my ship! We're stuck together until we get the money. [Drax throws the orb to Peter]\nDrax: I have no interest in money. [Drax walks off]\nPeter Quill: Great. That means more money for the three of us. [Groot makes a noise indicating he counts too] For the four of us. Partners.\nGamora: We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you. I'll tell the buyer we're on our way. And Quill, your ship is filthy. [she turns and walks up the stairs]\nPeter Quill: Oh, she has no idea. If I had a black light, the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.\nRocket: You got issues, Quill. [Ronan and Nebula are at the The Kyln torturing one of the prison guards]\nHead Riot Guard: I swear, I don't know where they went! I swear!\nNebula: If he knew where they were headed, he'd have already told us.\nHead Riot Guard: Yeah.\nNebula: Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison. Well, then, send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant. Find the orb. Any means, any price.\nNebula: And this place?\nRonan: The Nova can't know what we're after. Cleanse it! [Yondu pays a visit to the Broker to find out what Peter has done with the orb]\nYondu Udonta: Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one? I like to stick 'em all in a row on my control console.\nThe Broker: I can't tell if you're joking or not.\nKraglin: He's being fully serious.\nThe Broker: In that case, I can show you... [Yondu laughs]\nYondu Udonta: But first, you gonna tell me what this orb is, and why everybody cares so damn much about it. And then you gonna tell me, who out there might wanna buy it.\nThe Broker: Sir, the high-end community is a... [Yondu interrupts and mocks him by speaking gibberish] The high-end community is a... [Yondu continues to talk gibberish over the Broker] It's a tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again with more gibberish] Tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again] The high-end community is a very tight-knit... [Yondu interrupts him again talking gibberish making Kraglin laugh] I cannot possibly betray the confidentiality of my buyers! [Yondu threatens him by making his arrow float and hover towards the Broker's face]\nYondu Udonta: Now, who again is this buyer of yours? [on the Collector's ship]\nThe Collector: Carina.\nCarina: Yes, Master.\nThe Collector: Your people do have elbows, do they not?\nCarina: We do, Master.\nThe Collector: Then use them. I don't have to remind you what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me. Do I? [Carina fearfully looks at the previous servant who is now locked up in one of the glass cells on the Collector's ship] Chop, chop. Our guests will be here soon. [Carina quickly goes back to cleaning the glass cells] [back on the Milano]\nRocket: Heads up! We're inbound. [they all watch as they head towards Knowhere which looks like a giant severed-head]\nPeter Quill: Woh.\nDrax: What is it?\nGamora: It's called Knowhere. The severed head of an ancient celestial being. Be wary headed in, rodent. There are no regulations whatsoever here. [we see the Milano enter Knowhere, Mining Colony] Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in to mine the organic matter within the skull. The bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid. All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy. It's dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws. [we see the group walking around in the streets of Knowhere]\nPeter Quill: Well, I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde and John Stamos.\nDrax: It sounds like a place which I would like to visit.\nPeter Quill: Yeah, you should. [a bunch of kids surround them]\nKnowhere Kid: Excuse me.\nPeter Quill: [to the others] Watch your wallets.\nKnowhere Kid: Can you spare any units?\nRocket: Get out of here. [a girl walks up to Groot, he grows a flower in his hand, plucks it and gives it to her before walking off] [as they walk towards a bar] Your buyer's in there?\nGamora: We are to wait here for his representative. [we see a bouncer throws a patron out of the bar]\nBar Bouncer: Get out of here!\nDrax: This is no respectable establishment. What do you expect us to do while we wait? [while they wait for their appointment, Drax, Rocket and Groot get drunk and gamble] Yes! Yes!\nRocket: Yahoo!\nDrax: My Orloni has won, as I win at all things! Now, let's put more of this liquid into our bodies.\nRocket: That's the first thing you said that wasn't bat-shit crazy! [at the same time Peter and Gamora are on the balcony of the bar]\nPeter Quill: Man, you wouldn't believe what they charge for fuel out here. I might actually lose money on this job.\nGamora: My connection is making us wait.\nPeter Quill: It's just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty. Where yours is more, \"Stab, stab. Those are my terms.\" [Gamora smiles]\nGamora: My father didn't stress diplomacy.\nPeter Quill: Thanos?\nGamora: He's not my father. When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me. He tortured me, turned me into a weapon. When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan, I...I couldn't stand by and... [she notices Peter's Walkman on his belt and takes it] Why would you risk your life for this?\nPeter Quill: My mother gave it to me. My mom liked to share with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up. I happened to have it on me when I was...the day that she... You know, when I left Earth. [Peter takes the Walkman from Gamora and puts it back on his belt]\nGamora: What do you do with it?\nPeter Quill: Do? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.\nGamora: I'm a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.\nPeter Quill: Really? Well, on my planet, there's a legend about people like you. It's called \"Footloose.\" And in it, a great hero named Kevin Bacon, teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well...it's the greatest thing there is.\nGamora: Who put the sticks up their butts?\nPeter Quill: What? No, that's just a...\nGamora: That is cruel.\nPeter Quill: It's just a phrase people use. [Peter puts the Walkman headphones onto Gamora's head so she can listen to the music, after listening for a moment she speaks out loud]\nGamora: The melody is pleasant! [as Gamora listens to the music Peter's leans in to kiss her when suddenly Gamora puts a knife to his throat] No!\nPeter Quill: Ow! What the hell?\nGamora: I know who you are, Peter Quill! And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...your pelvic sorcery!\nPeter Quill: That is not what is happening here. [as Gamora lets go of his throat Peter notices Drax, Rocket and Groot are all fighting inside the bar] Oh, no. [Peter and Gamora enter the bar to stop the fight between Drax, Rocket and Groot, Gamora drags Drax off of Groot]\nGamora: Stop it! [Rocket points his weapon at Drax as he's about to shoot Peter intervenes]\nPeter Quill: Woh! Woh! What are you doing?\nDrax: This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!\n\nRocket: That is true!\n\nDrax: He has no respect!\nRocket: That is also true!\nPeter Quill: Hold on! Hold on!\nRocket: Keep calling me vermin, tough guy! You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!\nPeter Quill: Rocket, you're drunk. Alright? No one's laughing at you.\nRocket: He thinks I'm some stupid thing! He does! Well, I didn't ask to get made! I didn't ask to be torn apart, and put back together, over and over and turned into some...some little monster!\nPeter Quill: Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.\nRocket: He called me vermin! She called me rodent! Let's see if you can laugh after five or six good shots to your frickin' face! [as Rocket points his weapon at Drax again Peter stands in front of him]\nPeter Quill: No, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket! Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night and you're rich. [Rocket hesitates for a moment then lowers his weapon]\nRocket: Fine. But I can't promise when all this is over I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.\nPeter Quill: See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends! Five seconds after you meet somebody, you're already trying to kill them!\nDrax: We have traveled halfway across the quadrant, and Ronan is no closer to being dead. [Drax turns and leaves in anger]\nPeter Quill: Drax!\nGamora: Let him go. We don't need him. [just then the Collector's assistant, Carina, enters the bar]\nCarina: Milady Gamora, I'm here to fetch you for my master. [Carina escorts them to the Collector's home]\nRocket: Okay, this isn't creepy at all.\nCarina: We house the galaxy's largest collection of fauna, relics, and species of all manner. [she takes them to the Collectors massive room of collections where he's waiting for them] I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector. [Gamora and the Collector walk towards each other]\nThe Collector: Oh, my dear Gamora. How wonderful to meet in the flesh. [he kisses her hand]\nGamora: Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan. We have what we discussed. [as the Collector notices Groot]\nThe Collector: What is that thing there?\nGroot: I am Groot. [the Collector goes over to Groot]\nThe Collector: I never thought I'd meet a Groot. Sir, you must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass. At the moment of your death, of course.\nGroot: I am Groot.\nRocket: Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?\nThe Collector: [to Groot] That's your pet?\nRocket: His what?! [Rocket goes to grab his weapon and the Collector chuckles, Gamora intervenes]\nGamora: Tivan, we have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this orb.\nThe Collector: Very well, then. Let us see what you brought. [Gamora looks at Peter, he retrieves the orb from his bag but accidentally drops it, he quickly picks it up to show the Collector] [meanwhile a drunken Drax notices a man making a call in a booth]\nKnowhere Civilian: Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of cotati seeds. No, cases. Last time, you sent me... [suddenly Drax comes up from behind and holds a knife against his throat]\nDrax: You shall send a message for me. [back with the Collector and the group]\nThe Collector: Oh, my new friends. Before creation itself, there were six singularities. [he uses a device to unlock and open the orb] Then the universe exploded into existence, and the remnants of these systems were forged into concentrated ingots. Infinity Stones. These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength. Observe. [he shows them the giant beings that use the Infinity Stones as weapons] These carriers can use the stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field.\nPeter Quill: There's a little pee coming out of me right now.\nThe Collector: Once, for a moment, a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves, but even they were quickly destroyed by it. [the orb is opened to reveal an Infinity Stone] Beautiful. Beyond compare.\nRocket: Blah, blah, blah. We're all very fascinated, whitey. But we'd like to get paid.\nThe Collector: How would you like to get paid?\nRocket: What do you think, fancy man? Units!\nThe Collector: Very well, then. [as the Collector goes to get the money, Carina, fascinated by the Infinity Stone, walks towards it] Carina. Stand back.\nCarina: I will no longer be your slave!\nThe Collector: No! [Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that destroys herself as well the Collectors archive, Groot grabs Rocket and runs out of the place as it explodes; Peter and Gamora come out from under the table to look at the destruction caused by the explosion]\nPeter Quill: What the fff...? [Gamora grabs the orb and locks it back up to contain the Infinity Stone as they leave the Collector's place]\nGamora: How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the orb?\nRocket: What do you still have it for?\nPeter Quill: Well what are we gonna do, leave it in there?\nRocket: I can't believe you had that in your purse!\nPeter Quill: It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!\nGamora: We have to bring this to the Nova Corps. There's a chance they can contain it.\nRocket: Are you kidding me? We're wanted by the Nova Corps! Just give it to Ronan!\nPeter Quill: So he can destroy the galaxy?\nRocket: What are you, some Saint all of a sudden? What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you wanna save it?\nPeter Quill: Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!\nGamora: Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the stone to fall into Ronan's hands. We have to go back to your ship and deliver it to Nova.\nPeter Quill: Right, right, okay. I think you're right. Or we could give it to somebody who's not going to arrest us, who's really nice for a whole lot of money. I think it's a really good balance between both of your points of view.\nGamora: You're despicable.\nPeter Quill: I...\nGamora: Dishonorable. Faithless! [Gamora turns and starts to walk off when she notices Ronan and his crew arriving in their ships] Oh, no.\nDrax: At last! I shall meet my foe and destroy him.\nPeter Quill: You called Ronan? [just as Ronan's ships are landing Yondu and his men turn up too]\nYondu Udonta: Quill! Don't you move, boy! [Peter and Gamora make a run for it] Don't you move! Get out of the way! [Yondu chases after them, at the same time Ronan steps off his ship and Drax waits for him with his knives raised]\nDrax: Ronan the Accuser!\nRonan: You are the one who transmitted the message?\nDrax: You killed my wife. You killed my daughter! [Gamora, Rocket and Peter find the little mining pods and go to board three of them; to Groot]\nRocket: I told you, you can't fit. Now, wait here. I'll be back. [Nebula notices the three mining pods taking off]\nNebula: It is Gamora. She is escaping with the orb. [Nebula goes back to board their ship, Ronan turns to join her]\nDrax: No! [Drax runs towards Ronan he goes to strike him with his knife when Ronan easily dodges it]\nRonan: Nebula, retrieve the orb. [as Nebula takes off on the ship, Ronan stays behind to fight with Drax] [as Nebula is chasing after the three mining pods containing Rocket, Peter and Gamora]\nNebula: The stone is in the furthest pod. Bring it down! [Nebula chases Gamora's ship, at the same time Drax continues his battle with Ronan; as Nebula chases after Gamora Peter takes his pod over to Rocket's]\nPeter Quill: Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.\nRocket: How? We've got no weaponry on these things.\nPeter Quill: These pods are industrial grade, they're nearly indestructible.\nRocket: Not against necroblasts, they're not.\nPeter Quill: That's not what I'm saying.\nRocket: Oh! [Rocket takes his pod over to the two ships chasing them, he crashes into each one destroying them both, then as another one comes over to shoot at his pod, Rocket flies straight into it making it explode, Peter then hijacks one of the ships chasing them]\nPeter Quill: Let me borrow your ride. [Ronan and Drax continue their battle with Ronan beating Drax and holding him down by his throat]\nRonan: I don't recall killing your family. I doubt I'll remember killing you, either. [at the same time Nebula and her crew continue chasing after Gamora]\nGamora: Quill, I'm trapped! I can't make it to the Milano, I have to head out.\nPeter Quill: What? Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there. [Gamora takes her pod above the atmosphere with Nebula chasing after her]\nNebula: You are a disappointment, sister. Of all our siblings, I hated you least.\nGamora: Nebula, please. If Ronan gets this stone he'll kill us all.\nNebula: Not all. You will already be dead. [Nebula blows up Gamora's ship leaving Gamora floating in space and taking the Infinity Stone] [we see Ronan dragging and unconscious Drax on the ground and then throwing him into a tub of yellow liquid]\nNebula: Ronan, it is done. [at the same time Peter and Rocket watch Gamora's body as it floats in the atmosphere]\nRocket: Quill, come on. Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes, but there's nothing we can do for her. These pods aren't meant to be out here. In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat. [Rocket turns his pod and starts leaving]\nPeter Quill: Aw, damn it!\nRocket: Quill? [Peter reluctantly places a call]\nPeter Quill: Yondu! Yondu! This is Quill! My coordinates are two-two-seven-K-three-two- four.\nRocket: Quill? Quill, what are you doing?\nPeter Quill: Just outside Knowhere. If you're there, come get me. I'm all yours. [Peter then puts on his mask, exits the pod and goes over to Gamora]\nRocket: Quill, don't be ridiculous. Get back into your pod! You can't fit two people in there, you're gonna die. [Peter hold Gamora's body and starts to take off his mask] You'll die in seconds! Quill! [Peter puts his mask onto Gamora's head and she starts to breath, then Yondu's ship arrive and takes Peter and Gamora before they die] [as they enter Yondu's ship Gamora becomes conscious whilst Peter is still holding her]\nGamora: Quill? What happened?\nPeter Quill: I saw you out there. I don't know what came over me, but I couldn't let you die. I found something inside of myself. Something incredibly heroic. I mean, not to brag, but objectively... [Gamora sighs with frustration]\nGamora: Where's the orb?\nPeter Quill: It's...well, they got the orb.\nGamora: What? [just then a door opens and Yondu's men enter]\nKraglin: Welcome home, Peter. [Groot saves Drax out of the yellow liquid and helps him to breath, Rocket then lands his pod right in front of them and gets out]\nRocket: Blasted idiot. They're all idiots! Quill just got himself captured! [to Drax] None of this ever would have happened if you didn't try to single-handedly take on a frickin' army!\nRocket: Oh, boo-hoo-hoo. \"My wife and child are dead.\" [Groot gasps in shock at Rocket's callousness] Oh, I don't care if it's mean! Everybody's got dead people! That's no excuse to get everybody else dead along the way! Come on, Groot. Ronan has the stone. The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe as fast as we can and maybe, just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives before that whack-job ever gets there. [Groot rises to his feet in defiance]\nGroot: I am Groot.\nRocket: Save them? How?\nGroot: I am Groot.\nRocket: I know they're the only friends that we ever had, but there's an army of Ravagers around them. And there's only two of us! [Drax rises and stands next to Groot]\nDrax: Three. [Rocket grunts in anger and frustration, turns and starts kicking the ground with his feet]\nRocket: Aw! You're making me beat up grass! [back on board the Dark Astor Ronan contacts Thanos]\nRonan: The orb is in my possession, as I promised. [Korath holds up the orb in his hand]\nThanos: Bring it to me.\nRonan: Yes, that was our agreement. [Ronan takes the orb from Korath] Bring you the orb, and you will destroy Xandar for me. However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone, I wonder what use I have for you.\nThanos: Boy, I would reconsider your current course. [Ronan opens up the orb and looks at the Infinity Stone inside]\nKorath: Master! You cannot! Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.\nRonan: Not anymore. [suddenly Ronan embeds the Infinity Stone in his warhammer and absorbs its power into his body] You call me \"boy!\" I will unfurl one thousand years of Kree justice on Xandar, and burn it to its core! Then, Thanos, I'm coming for you. [he ends his call to Thanos]\nNebula: After Xandar, you're going to kill my father?\nRonan: You dare to oppose me?\nNebula: You see what he has turned me into. You kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets. [on Yondu's ship, Yondu is beating Peter who's being held by Yondu's men]\nYondu Udonta: You betrayed me! Steal my money!\nGamora: Stop it! Leave him alone!\nYondu Udonta: When I picked you up as a kid, these boys wanted to eat you. They ain't never tasted Terran before. I saved your life!\nPeter Quill: Oh, will you shut up about that? God! Twenty years, you've been throwing that in my face, like it's some great thing, not eating me! Normal people don't even think about eating someone else! Much less that person having to be grateful for it! You abducted me, man. You stole me from my home and from my family.\nYondu Udonta: You don't give a damn about your Terra! You're scared because you're soft, in here. [he beats his chest] Here! Right here! [Yondu grabs Peter again to hit him]\nGamora: Yondu! Listen to me! Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.\nYondu Udonta: I know what he's got, girl.\nGamora: Then you know we must get it back! He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar. We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.\nYondu Udonta: [to Peter, referring to Gamora] Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy? Sentiment? [he slaps Peter and his men laugh] Eating away your brain like maggots! That's it. [he whistles commanding his weapon fly over to point at Peter's throat]\nGamora: No!\nYondu Udonta: Sorry, boy. But a captain's gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.\nKraglin: Captain's gotta teach stuff! [the others grunt in agreement]\nPeter Quill: If you kill me now, you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen. [Yondu smiles and turns to face Peter]\nYondu Udonta: The Stone? I hope you got something better than that. Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.\nPeter Quill: We got a ringer.\nYondu Udonta: Is that right?\nPeter Quill: She knows everything there is to know about Ronan. His ships, his army.\nGamora: He's vulnerable.\nPeter Quill: Hey, what do you say, Yondu, huh? Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days. [Yondu hesitates as he thinks for a moment, then he whistles and his weapon moves from Peter's throat] [Yondu and his men start to laugh and Peter joins in]\nYondu Udonta: Let him go! Oh! You always did have a scrote, boy! That's why I kept you on as a young'un. [just then the ship shakes as it gets hit by something]\nRavager Pilot: Captain, the shot was non-damaging. [we see the Milano approaching Yondu's ship]\nRocket: Attention, idiots. The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer. [we see Drax in a space suit standing on top of the Milano holding a weapon] It's a weapon of my own design.\nYondu Udonta: What the hell?\nRocket: If you don't hand over our companions now, he's gonna tear your ship a new one. A very big new one!\nYondu Udonta: I ain't buyin' it.\nRocket: I'm giving you to the count of five. Five, four, three... [Peter and Gamora stop Kraglin from giving the order to blow up the Milano]\nPeter Quill: No!\nGamora: No, no! Don't!\nPeter Quill: No! Wait, hold on! [Peter quickly turns on the radio comm] Rocket, it's me, for God sakes! We figured it out! We're fine!\nRocket: Oh, hey, Quill. What's going on? [on board the Milano after Peter's explained his plan to the group] You call that \"figured it out\"? We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.\nPeter Quill: Oh, you want to talk about senseless? How about trying to save us by blowing us up?\nRocket: We were only gonna blow you up if they didn't turn you over!\nPeter Quill: And how on earth were they gonna turn us over when you only gave them a count of five?\nRocket: Well we didn't have time to work out the minutiae of the plan. This is what we get for acting altruistically!\nGroot: I am Groot.\nRocket: They are ungrateful.\nGamora: What's important now is we get the Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.\nRocket: So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?\nPeter Quill: We'll figure that part out later.\nGamora: We have to stop Ronan.\nRocket: How?\nPeter Quill: I have a plan.\nRocket: You've got a plan?\nPeter Quill: Yes.\nRocket: First of all, you're copying me from when I said I had a plan.\nPeter Quill: No, I'm not. People say that all the time, it's not that unique of a thing to say.\nRocket: Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.\nPeter Quill: I have part of a plan!\nDrax: What percentage of a plan do you have?\nGamora: You don't get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.\nDrax: I just saved Quill.\nPeter Quill: We've already established that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.\nDrax: When did we establish it?\n\nPeter Quill: Like three seconds ago!\n\nDrax: I wasn't listening, I was thinking of something else.\nGamora: [in frustration] Oh!\nRocket: She's right, you don't get an opinion. [to Peter] What percentage?\nPeter Quill: I don't know, twelve percent.\nRocket: Twelve percent? [Rocket laughs out loud]\nPeter Quill: That's a fake laugh.\nRocket: It's real!\nPeter Quill: Totally fake.\nRocket: That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life because that is not a plan.\nGamora: It's barely a concept.\nPeter Quill: You're taking their side?\nGroot: I am Groot.\nRocket: So what, it's better than eleven percent? What the hell does that have to do with anything?\nPeter Quill: Thank you, Groot. Thank you. See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue. [Peter turns to see Groot starting to chew on a leaf protruding from his shoulder, Peter shakes his head and Rocket chuckles] Guys. Come on. Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds. He expects to hear this big plan of ours. I need your help. I look around at us, you know what I see? Losers. I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff. And we have. Man, we have. All of us. Our homes, our families, normal lives. And, usually, life takes more than it gives, but not today. Today, it's given us something. It has given us a chance.\nDrax: To do what?\nPeter Quill: To give a shit. For once, not run away. I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.\nRocket: But, Quill, stopping Ronan, it's impossible. You're asking us to die.\nPeter Quill: Yeah, I guess I am. I... [Peter turns his back to the group in defeat]\nGamora: Quill. I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies. [Gamora rises to her feet] I will be grateful to die among my friends. [Drax rises to his feet]\nDrax: You are an honorable man, Quill. I will fight beside you. And in the end, see my wife and daughter again. [Groot rises next]\nGroot: I am Groot. [they all then look at Rocket, who finally sighs and gives in]\nRocket: Oh, what the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway. [Rocket also rises and stands on his seat] Now I'm standing. You all happy? We're all standing up now. Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle. [as they start to plan to take back the stone from Ronan]\nGamora: The stone reacts to anything organic. The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.\nPeter Quill: All Ronan's gotta do is touch the stone to the planet's surface and zap. All plants, animals, Nova Corps.\nGamora: Everything will die.\nPeter Quill: So Ronan does not make the surface. Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole in the Dark Aster's starboard hull. Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.\nKraglin: Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?\nDrax: I think of Sakaaran as paper people. [Kraglin smiles and gives Drax a friendly punch on the shoulder, but Drax, not understanding the playful jester, gives Kraglin a look like he's going to hit him]\nGamora: Once they know we're on board, Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck. Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.\nPeter Quill: We'll make it to the flight deck, and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.\nGamora: Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the stone. Use these devices to contain it. [the devices are passed out] If you touch it, it will kill you.\nPeter Quill: I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us. Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help. [we see Peter contacting Dey]\nRocket: There's one more thing we need to complete the plan. [he points to one of Yondu's men who has one robotic eye] That guy's eye...\nPeter Quill: No! No, we don't. No, we don't need that guy's eye.\nRocket: No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.\nRavager Navigator: Ronan's fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in t-minus fifteen minutes.\nYondu Udonta: [to Peter] Remember, boy. At the end of all this, I get the stone. You cross me, we kill you all. [after getting ready, Peter and the rest the group start walking along the ship] Let's go get 'em, boys! [Yondu's men leave on their ship; on the Milano]\nGamora: This is a terrible plan.\nPeter Quill: Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends. [at Nova Headquarters, Dey approaches Nova Prime]\nCorpsman Dey: Nova Prime. I received a transmission from one of the Ravagers. He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone and he's headed toward Xandar.\nNova Prime: Good God.\nDenarian Saal: It's a trick. He's a criminal.\nNova Prime: Did he say why we should believe him?\nCorpsman Dey: He said his crew just escaped from prison so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help. He says that he's an \"a-hole.\" But he's not, and I'm quoting him here, \"one hundred percent a dick.\"\nNova Prime: Do you believe him?\nCorpsman Dey: Well, I don't know that I believe anyone's one hundred percent a dick, ma'am.\nNova Prime: I mean, do you believe that he's here to help? [Dey hesitates a moment before replying]\nCorpsman Dey: Yeah. [on board the Dark Astor; to Ronan]\nNebula: A fleet approaches, they appear to be Ravagers. [the Ravagers fleet of ship stop near the Dark Astor]\nYondu Udonta: Fire! [the ships fire at the Dark Astor and the explosion bounces off the ship forming a cloud of fire] Cover it down! Submerge! [the ships, including the Milano duck beneath the wall of fire and go beneath the Dark Astor]\nPeter Quill: Rocket, hurry! [to the crew on Dark Astor]\nNebula: All pilots, dive! They're beneath us! [at Nova Headquarters]\nNova Prime: Evacuate the city. Our priority is to get our people away from the battle. [to her crew as the Ravegers ships and the Milano are firing at the Dark Astor]\nNebula: Forward thrust, now!\nKraglin: Come on! [after they've managed to blow a hole in the Dark Astor]\nRocket: Quill! Yondu! Now! [Yondu's ship is shot down]\nYondu Udonta: Aw, hell! I'm going down, Quill! No more games with me, boy! I'll see you at the end of this! [referring to the fleet of Ronan's ships firing at them]\nGamora: There are too many of them, Rocket! We'll never make it up there! [just then they notice Nova Corps ships joining them]\nDenarian Saal: Peter Quill, this is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps. For the record, I advised against trusting you here.\nPeter Quill: They got my \"dick\" message!\nDenarian Saal: Prove me wrong. [with the help of the Nova ships the Peter lands their ship inside the Dark Astor through the whole that was shot through it]\nDrax: Yes! [Drax laughs as they crash land inside the Dark Astor] Yes!\nGamora: [to Peter] We're just like Kevin Bacon.\nNebula: [to Ronan] The starboard kern has been breached! We have been boarded!\nRonan: Continue our approach.\nNebula: But the Nova Corps have engaged!\nRonan: None of that will matter once we reach the surface. [turning to the guards]\nNebula: Seal security doors! Now! [to the guards as she walks out of Ronan's chambers] Get out of my way! [Rocket looks up from ship at the Dark Astor who is being attacked by the Nova ships]\nRocket: Oh, man.\nNova Prime: All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade. The Dark Aster must not reach the ground. [the Nova ships start to form a giant net]\nNova Pilot #1: Locked in!\nNova Pilot #2: Locked in. We're locked in. [Nova ships capture the Dark Astor in their giant net shape form; inside the ship Peter and the rest of the group leave their ship and make their way through the Dark Astor]\nDrax: I can barely see. [Groot releases glowing particles from his body to light their way] When did you learn to do that?\nPeter Quill: I'm pretty sure the answer is \"I am Groot.\"\nGamora: The flight deck is three hundred meters this way.\nDrax: I want you all to know that I am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders. It is pleasing to once again have friends. You, Quill, are my friend.\nPeter Quill: Thanks.\nDrax: This dumb tree, he is my friend.\nGroot: Mmm.\nDrax: And this green whore, she, too...\nGamora: Oh, you must stop! [Nebula intercepts their progress across the Dark Astor]\nNebula: Gamora, look at what you have done. You have always been weak. You stupid, traitorous... [suddenly Drax a fires a shot at Nebula sending her flying off]\nDrax: Nobody talks to my friends like that.\nGamora: Head to the flight deck. I'll shut down the power to the security doors. [back down on Xandar after crash landing his ship, Yondu is surrounded by Ronan's army]\nMaskless Sakaaran: Yondu Udonta. Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps. [Yondu starts whistling which activates his arrow weapon to start floating up] Enough nonsense, Ravager! Time to die... [Yondu whistles again setting of his arrow which kills the entire platoon] [Gamora comes across Nebula as she rises pulling her cracked bones into place]\nGamora: Nebula, please. [Gamora and Nebula start battling it out as Gamora tries to shut down the power to the security doors]\nRonan: Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots, enact immolation initiative.\nNova Pilot: They're dive-bombing the city! Denarian Saal, should we break formation?\nDenarian Saal: No! Hold your positions! [Ronan's ships start attacking Xandar]\nRocket': Keep Ronan up there, Saal. We'll take care of the people down here.\nDenarian Saal: I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster. [back on the Dark Astor Peter and the rest of the group are intercepted by Korath and Ronan's crew]\nKorath: Star-lord.\nPeter Quill: Finally. [they all start battling it out] You thief! [as everyone is battling it out, Korath throws Drax aside]\nKorath: You will never make it to Ronan. [on Xandar; ordering Yondu's men]\nRocket: Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground. [Rocket and Yondu's men start shooting at Ronan's men in their ships; back on Dark Astor Gamora and Nebula continue to battle it out]\nGamora: Come on! [at the same time Peter and the rest of the group continue their battle with Korath and Ronan's crew, Drax manages to grab of hold of Korath and starts taking out part of his head]\nDrax: Finger to the throat means death. [he kills Korath and Peter walks over to Drax] Metaphor.\nPeter Quill: Yeah, sorta. [suddenly more of Ronan's crew come after them] Oh, no. [Groot saves them by skewering a bunch of the goons, then whipping them around to take out the rest, after which he turns to Peter and Drax and smiles] [on the Dark Astor Ronan gives a speech which is heard back at Nova Corps headquarters]\nRonan: Xandar, you stand accused. Your wretched peace treaty will not save you now. It is the tinder on which you burn! [Ronan activates the Infinity Stone which sets off burning a fire through the Dark Astor and destroying the Nova Crops ships that are attacking including Saal's ship]\nDenarian Saal: Rocket!\nRocket: Hold on, Saal, just... [Rocket watches as the fire destroys Saal's ship and the other Nova Corps ships] Quill, you gotta hurry. The city's been evacuated, but we're getting our asses kicked down here. [back on the Dark Astor, Peter continues to fight off Ronan's men as he makes his way to the bridge]\nPeter Quill: Gamora hasn't opened the door! [Gamora and Nebula continue to battle it out, Gamora manages to kick Nebula which throws her off the side of the ship, her arm catches something and she hangs off the edge, Gamora goes to help her]\nGamora: Nebula! Sister, help us fight Ronan. You know he's crazy!\nNebula: I know you're both crazy. [Nebula cuts off her own hand falls]\nGamora: No! [Nebula lands on a Ravager ship and smashes the window]\nRavager Pilot: What the...?\nNebula: Get out! [she throws the Ravager pilot off the ship] [Gamora opens the bridge's door and she along with Peter, Drax and Groot enter and Peter shoots Ronan with Rocket's super cannon]\nDrax: You did it! [suddenly Ronan rises and uses the power of his warhammer to throw the group aside, Drax rushes towards Ronan but Ronan grabs him by the throat and holds him up]\nRonan: I was mistaken, I do remember your family. Their screams were pitiful. I... [Rocket crashes the Milano into the bridge and seemingly destroys Ronan, the group then huddles together as the ship starts to plummet, Groot forms a giant nest around the group to keep them shielded]\nRocket: No, groot! You can't, you'll die. Why are you doing this? Why?\nGroot: We are Groot. [the ship then crashes] [everyone in the group has survived the crash except Groot, who is now a pile of twigs strewn all about, Rocket holds a bunch of the twigs in his hand in sadness]\nRocket: I called him an idiot. [just then Ronan emerges from the ship's wreckage, Rocket turns to face him] You killed Groot! [Rocket rushes towards Ronan who uses his warhammer power to throw Rocket aside]\nRonan: Behold! You're Guardians of the Galaxy! What fruit have they wrought? Only that my father and his father shall finally know vengeance. People of Xandar, the time has come to rejoice and renounce your paltry gods! Your salvation is at hand. [as Ronan prepares to use his power to destroy Xandar Peter stands up to and starts singing \"Ooh-ooh Child\"]\nPeter Quill: \"Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, things'll get brighter.\" [to Ronan] Listen to these words. [he starts singing again] \"Ooh-oo child, things are gonna get easier. Ooh-oo child, things'll get brighter.\" Now bring it down hard! [he starts dancing as he continues to sing] \"Some day, we'll get it together and we'll get it...\"\nRonan: What are you doing?\nPeter Quill: Dance-off, bro. Me and you. [as Peter dances he holds his hand out to Gamora] Gamora. [Gamora shakes her head] Subtle. Take it back. [Peter continues to dance]\nRonan: What are you doing?\nPeter Quill: I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom. [Rocket and Drax appear beside Ronan who use the super cannon to destroy the warhammer which frees the Infinity Stone, both Ronan and Peter go to grab it]\nGamora: No! [Peter grabs the stone which then begins to destroy him] Peter! Take my hand! [as Peter turns to Gamora he has flash back to when his mother asked him to take her hand on her death bed]\nMeredith Quill: Take my hand, Peter.\nPeter Quill: Mom.\nGamora: Take my hand! [with tears in his eyes Peter takes Gamora's hand, Drax then grabs his other hand and Rocket grabs Drax's hand, the power from the stone spread between the four of them]\nRonan: You're mortal! How?\nPeter Quill: You said it yourself, bitch. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy. [together with the power of the stone they destroy Ronan and Gamora uses the orb to contain the stone] [after destroying Ronan and containing the stone in the orb, Peter turns to look at Gamora, at the same time Yondu and his men show up]\nYondu Udonta: Well, well, well. Quite the light show. [he chuckles] Ain't this sweet. But you got some business to attend to before all the nookie-nookie starts.\nGamora: Peter, you can't. Peter.\nPeter Quill: You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I don't know who you're selling this to, but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps.\nYondu Udonta: I may be as pretty as an angel, but I sure as hell ain't one. Hand it over, son. [reluctantly Pete gives the orb to Yondu, who laughs and turns to leave with his men]\nPeter Quill: Yondu. [Yondu faces Peter again] Do not open that orb. You know that, right? You've seen what it does to people. [Yondu chuckles to himself and walks off] [as Yondu and his men take off in their ship they look down and Peter]\nKraglin: Yeah, Quill turned out okay. It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad like we was hired to do.\nYondu Udonta: Yeah, that guy was a jackass. [their ship takes off; to Gamora]\nPeter Quill: He's gonna be so pissed when he realizes I switched out the orb on him. [Peter holds the orb containing the stone in his hand and Gamora chuckles]\nGamora: He was gonna kill you, Peter.\nPeter Quill: Oh, I know. But he was about the only family I had.\nGamora: No. He wasn't. [Rocket is sat by Groot's pile of twigs crying when Drax sits next to him and starts stroking his head to comfort him] [Peter and the group are at the Nova Corps headquarters]\nPeter Quill: Why would you even know this?\nCorpsman Dey: When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system, so we had it checked out.\nPeter Quill: I'm not Terran?\nNova Prime: You are half Terran. Your mother was of earth. Your father, well, he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.\nGamora: That could be why you were able to hold the stone for as long as you did. [a door opens, Drax and Rocket have joined them with Rocket holding a pot with a tiny Groot planted in it]\nNova Prime: Your friends have arrived. On behalf of the Nova Corps, we'd like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving Xandar. If you will follow Denarian Dey, he has something to show you.\nPeter Quill: Thank you, Nova Prime.\nGamora: Thank you. [as the group follow Dey, Gamora walks next to Drax]\nGamora: Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.\nDrax: Yes. Of course, Ronan was only a puppet. It's really Thanos I need to kill. [the group follow Dey outside who takes them to the restored Milano]\nCorpsman Dey: We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible. We salvaged as much as we could.\nPeter Quill: Wow. I\u2026 [Peter looks speechless] Thank you.\nCorpsman Dey: I have a family who are alive because of you. Your criminal records have also been expunged. However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future.\nRocket: Question. What if I see something that I want to take, and it belongs to someone else?\nCorpsman Dey: Well you will be arrested.\nRocket: But what if I want it more than the person who has it?\nCorpsman Dey: Still illegal.\nRocket: That doesn't follow. No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand? [to Gamora who's laughing] What are you laughing at? Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman? [he starts following Gamora towards the Milano]\nDrax: What if someone does something irksome and I decide to remove his spine?\nCorpsman Dey: That's...that's actually murder. It's one of the worst crimes of all, so also illegal.\nDrax: Hmm. [Drax starts making his way to the Milano]\nPeter Quill: They'll be fine, Dey. I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.\nCorpsman Dey: You?\nPeter Quill: Yeah, me. [inside the Milano Peter holds the present his mother gave him before she died, he finally opens the letter and reads it]\nMeredith Quill: [voice over] Peter, I know these last few months have been hard for you. But I'm going to a better place and I will be okay. And I will always be with you. You are the light of my life. My precious son. My little Star-Lord. Love, mom. [Peter opens the present and sees it's another \"Awesome Mix\" tape, he puts the tape into his ship's cassette recorder, presses play and it starts playing \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, Gamora walks over to Peter and they smile at each other; we then see Yondu opening his orb to find inside it is a Troll doll, he smiles to himself; we see Dey returning home to his wife and daughter] [last lines; as Peter and the others prepare to take off, Drax smiles at Rocket who looks at the little Groot plant which starts to wake]\nPeter Quill: So, what should we do next? Something good? Something bad? A bit of both?\nGamora: We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord. [Peter smiles before replying]\nPeter Quill: Bit of both!\n\n\n[the Milano takes off to music from The Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back\"; as the credits start to roll we see a little bit larger version of Groot dancing to the music in his pot, he stops when Drax looks at him then starts dancing again when Drax turns again]\n\n\n[post-credits scene; The Collector is sitting in his destroyed archive drinking when a dog comes up and licks his face]\nHoward the Duck: Why do you let it lick you like that for?

        "text": "\n Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n Thor: Ragnarok\n\n[Adrian Toomes and his coworker, Phineas Mason, are studying a child's drawing of the Avengers.]\n\nToomes: Things are never gonna be the same now. I mean, look at this. You got aliens. You got big green guys tearing down buildings. When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians.\n\nMason: Actually, it's Native American, but whatever.\n\nToomes: Yeah. Tell you what, though. It ain't bad, is it?\n\n[Toomes squints at the drawing and Mason nods.]\n\nMason: No. Yeah. Kid's got a future.\n\nToomes: Yeah, well... We'll see, I guess.\n\n[Toomes looks up at the damaged Avengers Tower. Helicopters pass overhead. Scaffolding covers the tower's lower floors. A roving view sends us into a ruined building across the street.]\n\n\n[A clean-up crew works around a giant deceased Chitauri alien creature with pointed teeth. Alien artifacts lie among the rubble. Walking through the site, Toomes gives a worker a thumbs up. He turns to Herman Schultz, who is one of his workers.]\nToomes: No, hey! Uh-uh! You can't saw through that stuff. These alien bastards are tough. You gotta use the stuff they use.\n[He picks up an alien object from the ground and uses it as a tool to break down the Chitauri chariot.]\nToomes: See?\nSchultz: All right.\nToomes: All right. (to Brice) Oh, hey! Glad you could join us. Afternoon.\nBrice: Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.\nToomes: Yeah, yeah, yeah, your alarm. Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you. This is a huge deal for us.\n[Anne Marie Hoag, the director of the Department of Damage Control, walks into the salvage site with her crew.]\nAnne Marie Hoag: Attention, please! In accordance with Executive Order 396B, all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction. Thank you for your service. We'll take it from here.\nToomes: Who the hell are you?\nDODC Agent: Qualified personnel.\nToomes: Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so-\nAnne Marie Hoag: I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage operations are now under our jurisdiction. Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you've collected, or you will be prosecuted.\n[The workers look puzzled. A worker slips an alien artifact that looks like a power source into his pocket unnoticed.]\nToomes: Ma'am, what am I- Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on. Look... I bought trucks for this job. I brought in a whole new crew. These guys have a family. I have a family. I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.\nAnne Marie Hoag: I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.\n[Toomes is left to stare at her back as she leaves. Behind him, a Damage Control Agent speaks up.]\nDODC Agent: Maybe next time, don't over extend yourself.\n[Toomes looks around and grins.]\nToomes: What'd you say?\n[He looks around at his crew of workers. Brice whistles.]\nToomes: Yeah, he's right. I overextended myself.\n[Suddenly, he punches the agent. The agents point their guns at him.]\nWorker: Don't do it.\nAnne Marie Hoag: Put them down.\n[The agents lower their guns.]\nAnne Marie Hoag: If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors.\nToomes: Your superiors. Who the hell are they?\n[We see a TV screen playing the news about Tony Stark and his contract with Damage Control. Toomes watches the TV with an angry look on his face.]\nNews Anchor: A joint venture between Stark Industries and the federal government, the Department of Damage Control will oversee the collection and storage of alien and other exotic materials.\nSchultz:\u00a0So now the assholes who made this mess are being paid to clean it up.\nMason: Yeah, it\u2019s all rigged.\n[Mason is tinkering with the\u00a0alien power source that one of the workers stole from the salvage site earlier that day.]\nNews Anchor:\u00a0Experts estimate there are over fifteen hundred tons of exotic material scattered throughout the tri-state area.\n[The glowing alien artifact is now connected to a motor with wires. The blades on the motor start to spin and the machine floats off the table. One of the workers pulls off a tarpaulin sheet covering a large piece of Chitauri artifact, revealing a dozen of glowing Chitauri energy cores.]\nWorker: Hey, chief! We still have another load from yesterday. We\u2019re supposed to turn this in, right?\nBrice: I ain\u2019t hauling it.\nMason:\u00a0It\u2019s too bad. We could have made some pretty cool stuff from all that alien junk.\n[Toomes stares at the truck full of alien items and makes up his mind.]\nToomes:\u00a0I tell you what, let\u2019s keep it. The world\u2019s changing.\n[Mason lifts his magnifying goggles and looks at his boss.]\nToomes:\u00a0It\u2019s time we change, too.\n8 YEARS LATER[The Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cCan\u2019t You Hear Me Knocking\u201d is playing in the warehouse.\u00a0Workers are moving piles of alien tech and tinkering with machines. Mason works on an elaborate rifle gun. Another worker fires a neon blast from an exotic gun. The blast shears a large item in half. Workers load piles of high tech weapons onto a van.]\n[Cash pours through a money counting machine.]\n[A figure wearing a flying suit with expensive metal wings soars toward the warehouse. Doors in the ceiling open and the figure drops crates of alien tech from the suits\u2019 claw-like feet. The helmeted figure comes through the roof and lands on the platform. He steps out of the wing suit and faces Mason.]\nToomes: There you go, Mason.\n[The helmet opens, revealing Toomes. Mason grins.]\nToomes:\u00a0Business is good.\na Film by Peter Parker[Through a small, rectangular screen, we see the scenery of New York passing by at a high velocity. We seem to be on a highway.]\nPeter: (in a gravelly voice)\u00a0New York. Queens. It\u2019s a rough borough, but hey, it\u2019s home.\nHappy:\u00a0Who are you talking to?\n[Camera quickly pans to reveal Happy Hogan driving in the front seat.]\nPeter:\u00a0(in a normal voice)\u00a0No one. Just making a little video of the trip.\nHappy:\u00a0You know you can\u2019t show it to anyone.\nPeter:\u00a0Yeah, I know.\nHappy:\u00a0Then why are you narrating in that voice?\nPeter: Uh... Because it\u2019s fun.\nHappy:\u00a0Fun.\n[Apparently, Happy thinks this whole situation is the opposite of fun. He puts on his sunglasses and solemnly looks out the windshield.]\nPeter:\u00a0So, uh, why do they call you Happy?\n[Happy raises the limo\u2019s partition. We see a reflection of Peter Parker holding up his phone and filming.]\n[Peter gets out of the car to find a small private plane waiting for him.]\nHappy: Come on. I\u2019m not carrying your bags. Let\u2019s go.\nPeter: Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?\nHappy: There\u2019s a bathroom on it.\n[Inside the plane, we see a\u00a0view of the cockpit. Two seats for the pilot and the copilot are there\u00a0no one is sitting in them.]\nPeter: Whoa. No pilot? That\u2019s awesome.\n[Peter sits down across from Happy, directly facing him.]\nHappy: Is that where you\u2019re gonna sit?\nPeter: Yeah.\nHappy: This is your first time on a private plane?\nPeter: My first time on any plane.\n[Happy moves away to sit in another seat.]\nPeter: Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise?\n[Later. Peter puts a finger to his lips and makes a shushing sound.]\nPeter: Shh.\n[Camera reveals Happy snoring. At the sound of Peter\u2019s chuckle, Happy jerks awake, causing the whole frame to shake.]\n[Inside Berlin Brandenburg Airport, we see German signs, Happy dragging his luggage behind him, and Peter\u2019s face in quick succession.]\n[Peter is sightseeing Berlin. We see Berlin streets, the Brandenburg Gate, a street performer, foreign girls, and a pretzel vendor.]\nPeter: No one has actually told me why I\u2019m in Berlin or what I\u2019m doing. Something about Captain America going crazy.\n[Happy and Peter enter a hotel.]\nHappy: (pointing at a door) This is you.\nPeter: Oh, we\u2019re neighbors?\nHappy: We\u2019re not roommates. Suit up.\n[Peter's hotel room. Standing in front of a mirror, we see Peter wearing his homemade Spider-Man suit, consisting of a thin, baggy sweatshirt, goggles with shutters, and web-shooters.]\nPeter: Okay, Peter, you got this. You got this.\nHappy: What the hell are you wearing?\n[Happy is staring at Peter with a horrified look. Peter tilts down the camera to reveal his feet.]\nPeter: It\u2019s my suit.\nHappy: Where\u2019s the case?\nPeter: What case? That\u2019s not my...\n[Happy opens a door, showing Peter another area of his suite.]\nPeter: What? I thought that was a closet. This is still my room?\nHappy: Go. Please.\nPeter: My room is way bigger than...\nHappy: There.\n[A case is sitting on a coffee table.]\nPeter: I found the case. I found the case. I found the case.\n[He plucks up a card that says \u201cA minor upgrade -TS\u201d from the case.]\nPeter: \u201cA minor upgrade\u201d?\n[When Peter unbuckles a lock the case unfolds itself, revealing a high tech Spider-Man suit complete with awesome holograms.]\nPeter: Whoa. Oh my God.\nHappy: Put it on.\nPeter: What the...? This is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen-\nHappy: Let\u2019s go.\nPeter: But, yeah. Well, I don\u2019t understand. Is it for me?\n[Camera spins to find Happy leaving the room.]\nPeter: Happy, Happy, wait.\n[Peter takes off the mask of his homemade Spider-Man suit with a huge, excited grin on his face.]\nPeter: This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. This is the greatest day of my life.\nHappy: Let\u2019s go.\n[He has come to drag a hyped-up Peter out of the room.]\nPeter: Okay.\nHappy: Come on.\n[Outside Flughafen Leipzig-Halle, We see Iron Man, War Machine, Captain America, Black Widow, and Black Panther confronting each other.]\nPeter: (whispers) Okay, there\u2019s Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. Whoa. Who\u2019s that new guy?\nTony: Underoos!\n[We see Peter, now dressed in the Spider-Man suit that Tony gave him.]\nPeter: Oh, that\u2019s me. I gotta go. I gotta go.\n[Peter puts down the phone and proceeds to snatch Captain America\u2019s shield with his web.]\n[Later.]\nPeter: Hey, everyone.\n[He is holding his camera and flying through the air to find a safe spot. We see and hear explosions everywhere.]\nPeter: Okay, so the craziest thing just happened, right? I just had a fight with Captain America and I stole his shield and I threw it at him-\n[We hear a metallic noise. Ant-Man grows into a giant in the background and grabs War Machine by his ankle. Peter turns to see this.]\nPeter: What the hell? He\u2019s big now. I gotta go. Hang on.\n[The phone is put down and for a moment, all we see are the sky and the clouds. Then we hear the battle commencing and see Peter being flung through the air.]\nPeter: Whoa!\n[Back in Peter's hotel room. Peter is facing the camera, now dressed in a grey NASA T-shirt. It is obvious that he is still high on adrenaline.]\nPeter: It was the most amazing thing that\u2019s ever happened! So Mr. Stark was like, \u201cHey, Underoos!\u201d and I just sort of flipped in and I stole Cap\u2019s shield. I was like, \u201cHey, what\u2019s up, everybody?\u201d And then...\n[There\u2019s a knock on his door.]\nPeter: Hey, just a second! Coming!\n[He backflips to the door, but before he can open it, Happy enters in a bathrobe.]\nPeter: Hey.\nHappy: We have thin walls here.\n[Camera starts rolling. We are now inside Tony's car. A hand reaches for it and we tilt up to find Tony Stark in a suit and sunglasses ensemble.]\nTony: What are you doing, a little video diary?\nPeter: (embarrassed) Yeah.\nTony: It\u2019s all right. I\u2019d probably do the same.\nHappy: (from the driver\u2019s seat) I told him not to do it. He was filming everything.\nTony: It\u2019s okay.\nHappy: I\u2019m gonna wipe the chip.\nTony: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what? We should actually... We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?\n[Tony takes off his sunglasses, revealing a badly bruised face.]\nPeter: Yeah, hold on.\nTony: We rolling?\nPeter: An alibi? Sure.\nTony: Get in the frame.\nPeter: Okay.\nTony: Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.\n[Peter turns to Tony with a frown on his face. Tony chuckles and pats Peter\u2019s shoulder, whose face now wears an uncomfortable smile.]\nTony: Peter, that\u2019s inappropriate. All right, let\u2019s start over. You can edit it.\nPeter: Mm-hmm.\n[Looking at Tony, Peter chuckles.]\nTony: Three, two, one. Hey, May. My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend at the Stark internship retreat. Everyone was impressed.\n[Tony is putting on a solemn face. Peter offers the camera a wide-eyed, tight-lipped smile, trying to look innocent. Suddenly, we hear a loud honk.]\nHappy: Come on! It\u2019s a freaking merge. (to Tony) I\u2019m sorry.\nTony: This is because you\u2019re not on Queens Boulevard. (to the camera) See, Happy is... is hoping to get bumped up to asset management. He was forehead of security, and before that, he was just a driver.\n[Still driving, Happy gives Tony a sidelong glance.]\nHappy: That was a private conversation. I don\u2019t like joking about this. It was hard for me to talk to you about that.\nTony: No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?\n[Happy slams on the brakes, making the car screech to a stop.]\nHappy: All right. Here we are. End of the line. Whoops.\n[Tony laughs and films Peter, who looks a bit pale.]\nTony: Happy, can you give us a moment?\nHappy: You want me to leave the car?\nTony: Why don\u2019t you grab Peter\u2019s case out of the trunk.\n[Peter\u2019s film finally stops rolling. He slowly lowers his phone, shocked.]\nPeter: I can keep the suit?\nTony: Yes, we were just talking about it.\n[Tony puts his sunglasses back on and clears his throat. Through the rear window, we see Happy struggling with Peter\u2019s case.]\nTony: Do me a favor, though. Happy\u2019s kind of your point guy on this. Don\u2019t stress him out. Don\u2019t do anything stupid. I\u2019ve seen his cardiogram. All right?\nPeter: (enthusiastically) Yes.\nTony: Don\u2019t do anything I would do, and definitely don\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t do. There\u2019s a... There\u2019s a little grey area in there, and that\u2019s where you operate.\nPeter: Wait, does that mean that I\u2019m an Avenger?\nTony: No.\n[Happy knocks on the window and holds the case up.]\nHappy: This it?\nTony: Seventh floor.\nPeter: I can take that. You don\u2019t have to take it.\nHappy: You\u2019re gonna take it?\nPeter: Yeah, I can take that.\nHappy: Thank you.\n[Happy drops the case by the car.]\nPeter: So when\u2019s, when\u2019s our next... When\u2019s our next \u201cretreat,\u201d you know? Like...\nTony: What, next mission?\nPeter: Yeah, the mission. The missions.\nTony: We\u2019ll call you.\nPeter: Do you have my numbers?\nTony: No, I mean, we\u2019ll call you. Like, someone will call you.\nPeter: Oh.\nTony: All right?\nPeter: From your team.\nTony: Okay.\n[Tony reaches for the door. Peter mistakes the gesture as a hug and brings his arms around Tony.]\nTony: It\u2019s not a hug. I\u2019m just grabbing the door for you. We\u2019re not there yet.\n[Peter awkwardly climbs out of the car. Almost as an afterthought, Tony calls out:]\nTony: Bye.\n[Tony and Happy drive off. Holding his bag and the Spider-Man suit case, Peter grins.]\nPeter: They\u2019re gonna call me.\n[He heads to the apartment entrance. There is a definite spring in his step.]\nTWO MONTHS LATER[Peter is standing in a packed subway train. He takes out his phone and types out a text.]\nHey Happy just checking in.\u00a0I'm out of school at 2:45 PMReady for my next mission!It's Peter BTW.Parker[He scrolls through numerous unanswered messages to Happy.]\n[The train drops Peter off at 36th Avenue Station, which is right next to Midtown High. He walks downstairs to street level where football fields stand surrounded by fences. Peter strolls down the sidelines and approaches the main building. We see students playing all kinds of sports on the field. He climbs a flight of stairs, then quickly avoids being hit by a convertible driven by Flash Thompson, a slick-haired teenager.]\nFlash: What\u2019s up, Penis Parker?\n[Students chuckle at that. Peter suppresses a sigh and moves on.]\n[A school news report is playing in the hallway, Betty Brant and Jason Ionello as the news anchors.]\nBetty: Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.\nJason: Students, don\u2019t forget about your homecoming tickets. Do you have a date for homecoming?\nBetty: Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.\nJason: Okay.\nBetty: Yeah.\n[On TV, we see Jason rolling his eyes awkwardly.]\nPrincipal Morita: Good morning.\n[A teenage boy flies a drone around the crowded hallway. Peter walks by. Principal Morita grabs the drone out of the air.]\nPrincipal Morita: Damn it. You, in my office right now.\n[The drone pilot follows the principal. Other students carry elaborate science projects. Peter stops at his locker and takes off his jacket. He enters the combination and opens the locker. We see Peter from inside the locker. Suddenly, a hand pops up behind him. It\u2019s Ned Leeds holding a Palpatine Lego figure over Peter\u2019s shoulder.]\nNed: (imitating Emperor Palpatine) Join me, and together... we\u2019ll build my new Lego Death Star.\nPeter: What?\n[Peter glances around and hears a cheerleader say:]\nCheerleader: So lame.\nPeter: No way! That\u2019s awesome. How many pieces?\nNed: Three thousand eight hundred and three.\nPeter: That\u2019s insane.\nNed: I know. You want to build it tonight?\nPeter: No, I can\u2019t tonight. I\u2019ve got the Stark-\nNed: Mm-hmm. Stark internship.\nPeter: Yeah, exactly.\n[Having picked up his textbooks, Peter starts to walk down the hallway with his best friend.]\nNed: Always got that internship.\nPeter: Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it\u2019ll lead to a real job with them.\nNed: That would be so sweet.\nPeter: Right?\nNed: He\u2019d be all, \u201cGood job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here\u2019s a gold coin.\u201d\n[Peter gives him a look.]\nNed: I don\u2019t know how jobs work.\nPeter: That\u2019s exactly how they work.\nNed: Oh. (chuckles) I\u2019ll knock out the basic bones of the Death Star at my place. And, and then I\u2019ll come by afterwards...\n[His voice fades out as Peter slows to a stop. In slow motion, we see who caught his eye- a pretty dark-haired girl talking with her friends down the hall. Her name is Liz. She brushes her hair back and their eyes meet for a fleeting moment. Peter is mesmerized. He can barely keep up with his conversation with Ned.]\nNed: ...because for the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.\nPeter: That\u2019d be great.\n[The school bell rings.]\nGirl: I\u2019m gonna be late!\n[We are now in physics class.]\nMs. Warren: Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B?\n[She points at Flash, who is confidently holding up his hand.]\nMs. Warren: Flash.\nFlash: It\u2019s the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by the mass.\nMs. Warren: Nope.\n[Another hand goes up, but Ms. Warren calls out a student who clearly is having difficulty focusing on the lecture.]\nMs. Warren: Peter. You still with us?\n[Peter has been watching a video of Spider-Man on YouTube.]\nPeter: Uh... Uh... Yeah, yeah.\n[He closes the laptop, revealing a diagram of a simple gravity pendulum.]\nPeter: Uh... Mass cancels out, so it\u2019s just gravity times sine.\nMs. Warren: Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn\u2019t always the best if you are wrong.\n[The class bursts out in laughter. Flash has turned in his seat and is glaring at Peter.]\nFlash: (whispers) You\u2019re dead.\n[Peter turns to glance at a clock. 11:38 a.m.]\n[When Peter faces the front, we see that he is now wearing safety goggles.]\nMr. Cobbwell: Today we\u2019ll be talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr, but trust me, there is nothing Bohr-ing about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.\n[As Mr. Cobbwell continues on his introduction on Bohr, Peter opens his notes to a page titled \u201cWeb Fluid Version 3.01.\u201d We see molecule diagrams and a list of liquids such as salicylic acid, toluene, and methanol.]\n[Inside an open drawer is a beaker. Peter quickly and surreptitiously pours some orange liquid in it and stirs the concoction. It starts to increase in volume, running over the beaker walls. When Peter lifts the glass stirring rod, the compound sticks to it like spiderweb. Flustered, Peter quickly shuts the drawer and looks at the clock. It\u2019s 12:35 p.m.]\n[A homecoming banner is hung over the clock on the cafeteria wall by Liz, who is standing on a ladder. Peter and Ned are sitting next to each other and watching her.]\nPeter: Did Liz get a new top?\nNed: No. We\u2019ve seen that before, but never with that skirt.\n[A girl passes by and says hello to Liz.]\nGirl: Liz, hey.\nLiz: Hi!\nGirl: That looks so good!\nPeter: We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.\nMichelle: Too late.\n[Peter and Ned turn to see Michelle sitting at the other end of their table.]\nMichelle: You guys are losers.\nNed: But then why do you sit with us?\nMichelle: Because I don\u2019t have any friends.\n[A poster hangs on the auditorium wall. It is for the Academic Decathlon nationals taking place in Washington D.C. on October 13-15. The Decathlon practice is commencing. Liz is standing at a podium, reading the quiz cards. Ned, Charles, Abe, and Cindy are seated on the stage. Bells are placed in front of them.]\nLiz: Let\u2019s move to the next question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?\nCharles: Hydrogen\u2019s the lightest. That\u2019s not the question. Okay. Yeah.\nAbe: Uranium.\n[Cindy Moon, who was frantically searching the books, glares at Abe.]\nLiz: That is correct. Thank you, Abraham.\nAbe: (quietly pumping his fist in the air) Yes.\nLiz: Please open your books to page ten.\n[A few feet away, Peter is conversing with Mr. Harrington, the teacher who is in charge of the Decathlon team.]\nMr. Harrington: Peter, it\u2019s nationals. Is there no way you could take one weekend off?\nPeter: I can\u2019t go to Washington because if Mr. Stark needs me, then I have to make sure that I\u2019m here.\nFlash: You\u2019ve never even been in the same room as Tony Stark.\n[Flash speaks up from behind them, reading a book with his feet propped up in a chair.]\nCindy: Wait, what\u2019s happening?\n[Sally Avril, who is lying on her stomach and studying her notes, answers her.]\nSally: Peter\u2019s not going to Washington.\nCindy: No. No, no, no, no, no. No. No.\n[Abe rings the bell beside her.]\nAbe: Why not?\nLiz: Really? Right before nationals?\nMichelle: He already quit marching band and robotics lab.\n[Everyone looks at Michelle, who is leaning on the wall with a book, with a suspicious look on their faces. Michelle quickly adds:]\nMichelle: I\u2019m not obsessed with him. Just very observant.\nLiz: Flash, you\u2019re in for Peter.\nFlash: Ooh, I don\u2019t know. I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.\n[Abe rings the bell.]\nAbe: That is false.\nMr. Harrington: What did I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?\n[Peter turns to see the clock: it\u2019s still 1:18 p.m.]\n[We see quick glimpses of Peter fidgeting as he looks at the clock. Fingers drumming the desk, foot tapping on the floor until finally, the clock hits 2:45 p.m. and the school bell rings.]\n[The bell barely stops ringing before Peter reaches the front steps of the building. Looking around to check if anyone\u2019s watching him, he leaps over a fence taller than himself without touching it.]\n[Peter runs toward a deli and nods at a man sitting at the corner.]\nPeter: Hey, what\u2019s up?\nMan: Hey, man.\n[Peter enters Delmar's Deli-Grocery and heads to the counter. He seems like he\u2019s quite a regular at the store.]\nPeter: What\u2019s up, Mr. Delmar?\nMr. Delmar: Hey, Mr. Parker. Number five, right?\n[Peter picks up jelly in a plastic bag and puts it on the counter. It says \"Best By 03.16.18.\"]\nPeter: Yeah, um, and, uh, with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks.\nDeli Clerk: You got it, boss.\nMr. Delmar: How\u2019s your aunt?\nPeter: Yeah, she\u2019s alright.\n[Mr. Delmar turns to speak to his staff in Spanish.]\nMr. Delmar: La t\u00eda de \u00e9 les una italiana muy bellissima. (His aunt is a very hot Italian woman.)\nDeli Clerk: \u00bfAh, s\u00ed? (Oh, yeah?)\nPeter: \u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1 tu hija, eh? (How is your daughter, huh?)\n[The deli staff hoots behind the counter. Delmar\u2019s grin fades.]\nMr. Delmar: Ten dollars.\nPeter: It\u2019s five dollars.\nMr. Delmar: For that comment, ten dollars.\nPeter: Hey, come on, I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m joking.\n[Peter pulls out some cash from his wallet and hands it over to Delmar. Delmar takes the money with a grumpy look on his face.]\nPeter: Here\u2019s five dollars.\n[Peter moves toward a fat cat lying on the counter and pets him.]\nPeter: What\u2019s up, Murph? How you doing, buddy?\n[When he returns to collect his food, Mr. Delmar strikes up a conversation.]\nMr. Delmar: So, how\u2019s school?\nPeter: Ah, you know, it\u2019s boring. Got better things to do.\nMr. Delmar: Stay in school, kid. Stay in school. Otherwise, you\u2019re gonna end up like me.\nPeter: This is great.\nMr. Delmar: Best sandwiches in Queens.\n[He hands Peter his sandwich.]\n[Peter leaves the store and runs across the street with a bag of sandwich in his hand. He passes under an elevated train track, holding up his palm at a cab that honks at him, and runs into an alley. He takes off his shoes and throws them aside. He seems to be in a hurry.]\n[From his backpack, Peter pulls out a blue and red Spider-Man suit. He knocks over a garbage can as he awkwardly takes off his pants. Peter yanks off his shirt and sweater, then steps into his suit, wearing only his boxers. Jumping, he pulls the full-body suit up over his legs. Peter fits his arms in the sleeves, then puts on the mask, which covers his entire head. The baggy suit hangs loosely over his slender frame.]\n[Peter webs his backpack against a dumpster, then hits the spider emblem on his chest. The material shrinks, fitting him snugly.]\n[Peter presses a button on his web-shooter, activating hologram displays, adjusts the lenses on his high tech mask, and jumps onto the roof of a building. \u201cBlizkrieg Bop\u201d by Ramones starts to play as he leaps across roofs with his sandwich bag in hand. Crouching down on a ledge, he looks down at the streets and sighs.]\nPeter: Ah, finally.\n[A bicycle chain is broken. The thief rides the stolen bike down a sidewalk, pushing passersby off the street. Peter swings after him, lands in front of him, and holds out one end of a strand of web.]\nPeter: Hey, could you hold this for a second? Thanks.\n[When the thief looks down at his hand, Peter uses his momentary distraction to glue him to the web. Peter lets go and the thief is pulled into the air. The thief still dangling above him, Peter holds up the bike and searches for its owner.]\nPeter: Hey, is this anybody\u2019s bike? No?\n[A man comes out of a store.]\nPeter: Hey, buddy, is this your bike?\nMan: I have no change.\nPeter: Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?\n[On the handle of the bike, Peter has left a note saying: \u201cIS THIS YOUR BIKE? IF NOT, DON\u2019T STEAL IT! SPIDER-MAN.\u201d]\n[Peter swings by a train station high above ground level and strikes a pose.]\nPeter: Whoo! Everybody good?\n[He then rides on top of a subway car, reading something on his phone.]\n[Peter is slowly standing up on the edge of a building, the flag of the United States billowing in the wind behind him, when a man calls out:]\nStreet Vendor: Hey! You\u2019re that spider guy on YouTube, right?\nPeter: Call me Spider-Man!\nStreet Vendor: Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.\n[Peter does a backflip on the roof.]\nStreet Vendor: Yeah!\nMan: Not bad.\n[One moment, Peter is swinging down from rooftops and yelling, and another moment, he is patiently giving directions to an old woman. A thin strand of web suspended between a building and an old, rusty water tank, he practices his tightrope skills, too.]\n[A man tries to open a car door with a thin slab of metal. Peter sees this, jumps onto the roof of the car, then uses his web to bang the man\u2019s head on the car. The car starts to make loud beeping noises.]\nPeter: Hey, buddy. Shouldn\u2019t steal cars. It\u2019s bad.\n[Peter glues the man\u2019s hand to the car and jumps off.]\nCar Jacker: It\u2019s my car, dumbass!\n[An old woman, Marjorie, looks out from her window and starts to shout at Peter. All hell breaks loose.]\nMarjorie: Hey! Shut that off!\nPeter: I was just tryin\u2019 to-\nCar Jacker: Can you tell him it\u2019s my car?\nDay Sleeper: I work at nights! Come on, dude!\nOld Man: That\u2019s not your car! That\u2019s his car.\nPeter: How was I supposed to know? He was putting that thing in the window!\nResident 1: Every day with these damn alarms!\nResident 2: Shut it off!\n[The neighbors continue to shout at Peter. An old, white-haired man wearing sunglasses (Stan Lee cameo) shouts at Peter, but then Marjorie notices him from the building across the street.]\nGary: Don\u2019t make me come down there, you punk!\nMarjorie: Hey, Gary. How you doing?\nGary: Marjorie, how are you? How\u2019s your mother?\n[Later. Peter swings through an alley. His grip on his web slips, causing him to fall on his face.]\nPeter: Ugh! I\u2019m good, I\u2019m good.\n[Later. The sun is setting]\nVoicemail: You have reached the voicemail box of...\nHappy: Happy Hogan.\n[We find Peter perching on a fire exit high above the ground and munching on his sandwich.]\nPeter: Hey, Happy! Um, here\u2019s my report for tonight. I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn\u2019t find the owner, so I just left a note. Um... I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice and bought me a churro. So I just, um, feel like I could be doing more. You know? Just curious when the next real mission is gonna be. So, yeah, just call me back. It\u2019s Peter. Parker.\n[Peter hangs up his phone and sighs.]\nPeter: Why would I tell him about the churro?\n[A warning signal blinks on his web-shooter. Web fluid low. Peter ejects the cartridge, then scrambles to catch it, standing sideways off the fire escape. He places the cartridge on his belt. And spots four men entering a closed bank.]\nRobber 1: Can\u2019t wait to see this thing, guys.\nPeter: Finally, something good.\n[Inside Queens Community Bank, a robber wearing a Hulk mask is cutting the ATM with a high tech tool that has a glowing Chitauri energy core inside.]\nRobber 1: Yo, this high tech stuff makes it too easy.\nRobber 2: Told you it was worth it.\nRobber 1: Okay, go, go, go.\n[Another robber uses a high tech device to grab and pull off the front of the ATM. The huge chunk of metal is suspended in air. Other robbers start to bag the cash.]\nRobber 3: Oh, nice.\nRobber 4: We can hit, like, five more places tonight.\n[Behind them, Peter silently comes through the door and awkwardly tries to strike a casual but cool-looking pose.]\nPeter: (clears his throat) What\u2019s up, guys? You forgot your PIN number?\n[The robbers turn to him. Reveal that they are wearing cheap plastic masks of the Avengers. The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron man.]\nPeter: Whoa! You\u2019re the Avengers. What are you guys doing here?\n[One of the robbers loads his gun but Peter uses his web to grab it and hit \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cThor\u201d with it. He then proceeds to push \u201cHulk\u201d away. His sticky feet hold \u201cThor\u201d and throw him into a wall.]\nPeter: Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys. I thought you\u2019d be more handsome in person.\n[Peter is hanging upside down from the ceiling when \u201cIron Man\u201d starts to throw aimless punches at him.]\nPeter: Iron Man. Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You\u2019re a billionaire.\n[\u201cHulk\u201d comes up with a high tech weapon. Peter quickly dodges a punch from \u201cIron Man,\u201d who loses balance and ends up punching \u201cHulk\u201d instead. They both fall to the ground. Meanwhile, \u201cCaptain America\u201d succeeds in picking up the high tech device that had been used to pull the metal chunk off the ATM and aims it at Peter. Peter jumps at him but is suspended in air for a short time. His voice is all distorted when he says:]\nPeter: Hey! Oh, this feels so weird.\n[He is thrown against the wall.]\nPeter: Whoa, what is that thing?\n[He is once more caught in the force field of the device and is thrown back and forth between the ceiling and the floor.]\nPeter: I\u2019m starting... to think... you\u2019re not... the Avengers!\n[With his sticky fingers, he holds onto the ground and shoots his web at a desk in the corner. He pulls on it and hits \u201cCaptain America\u201d with his force field device.]\n[Mr. Delmar is watching the attempted bank robbery from his deli across the street; money flying everywhere, Spider-Man jumping off walls, the \u201cAvengers\u201d trying to fight him.]\n911 Operator: 911. What\u2019s your emergency?\nMr. Delmar: Uh... Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st street.\nPeter: Alright guys, let\u2019s wrap this up. It\u2019s a school night.\n[Peter kicks \u201cThor\u201d into a glass wall, making it crack. \u201cIron Man\u201d holds up the force field device, but before he can do anything, Peter webs the device against the glass, jumps onto \u201cIron Man,\u201d and checks his face underneath the mask.]\nPeter: So, how do jerks like you get tech like this?\n[\u201cHulk\u201d fires up the device that cuts through metal.]\nPeter: No. Wait, wait, wait!\n[Peter quickly pulls \u201cIron Man\u201d and himself out of the way. The plasma blast cuts through walls and hits Mr. Delmar\u2019s store across the street. The deli-grocery bursts into flames.]\nPeter: Mr. Delmar.\n[Peter quickly runs into the decimated store.]\nPeter: Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in there? Is anybody in here? Hello?\n[He helps Mr. Delmar, who is wheezing and coughing but alive, out of the burning building. Murph the cat is safe in Peter\u2019s arms, too. But when he turns to the bank, he finds that it is empty. The robbers have escaped.]\nPeter: Oh, come on. You\u2019ve got to be-\n[The cat starts to meow. Peter hands Murph to Mr. Delmar.]\nPeter: Here, here.\nMr. Delmar: Good, yeah.\n[Inside the Avengers Tower, Tony\u2019s belongings are being packed up. Dum-E picks up an expensive-looking china vase.]\nHappy: (to Dum-E) Okay. Good. Yes. Yes- No. No, put that down. That\u2019s worth more than you or me. (takes a call) Yeah?\n[Peter is running down a rooftop.]\nPeter: Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me. These guys were robbing an ATM with these high tech weapons-\nHappy: Hey, take a breath, okay? I don\u2019t have time for ATM robberies...\nPeter: Yeah, but-\nHappy: ...or the thoughtful notes you leave behind. I have moving day to worry about. Everything\u2019s gotta be out of here by next week.\n[Peter jumps onto another rooftop, then stops in his tracks.]\nPeter: Wait. Wait! You\u2019re moving? Who\u2019s moving?\nHappy: Yeah, don\u2019t you watch the news? Tony sold Avengers Tower. We\u2019re relocating to a new facility upstate where, hopefully, the cell service is much worse.\nPeter: But what about me?\n[It is Happy\u2019s turn to be confused.]\nHappy: What about you?\n[Peter sits down on a streetlamp.]\nPeter: Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something, I don\u2019t know, something big goes down? Can I please just talk to Mr. Stark?\nHappy: Look, just stay away from anything too dangerous. I\u2019m responsible for making sure you\u2019re responsible, okay?\n[Peter leaps down into the alley he stashed his backpack in.]\nPeter: I am responsible. I- Oh, crap. My backpack\u2019s gone.\n[Happy is now standing inside an elevator.]\nHappy: That doesn\u2019t sound responsible.\nPeter: I\u2019ll call you back.\nHappy: Feel free not to.\n[The elevator doors slide close as Happy cuts the call.]\n[Peter puts his mask back on and runs out of the alley.]\n[Peter climbs up his apartment building, still clad in his Spider-Man suit and dodging windows. He slides the top of his bedroom window open and looks inside. Aunt May passes in front of his open door.]\n[Peter climbs into the bedroom via his ceiling and closes the window with his foot. He pulls off his mask, throws it away, and crawls across the ceiling. Trying to make no sound, he pushes the door close and hops down to the floor. We hear a quiet click as the door latch slides into place.]\n[Peter makes a turn to find Ned sitting on his bed. Shocked, mouth agape. The Lego Death Star crashes to the ground and breaks down into pieces.]\nMay: What was that?\nPeter: Uh, it\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s nothing!\nNed: You\u2019re the Spider-Man. From YouTube.\nPeter: I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not.\n[Peter presses the spider emblem on his chest. The suit becomes baggy again and falls down from his body.]\nNed: You were on the ceiling.\nPeter: No, I wasn\u2019t. Ned, what are you doing in my room?\nNed: May let me in. You said we were gonna finish the Death Star.\nPeter: You can\u2019t just bust into my room!\n[May opens the door, setting her hair free from a low bun. She waves a rag in front of her face to dissipate the smoke coming from the kitchen.]\nMay: The turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let\u2019s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?\nNed: Yes.\nPeter: No. He\u2019s got a thing.\nNed: A thing to do after.\nMay: Okay.\n[She waves a finger at Peter, who is clad only in his boxers.]\nMay: Maybe put on some clothes.\n[May leaves and closes the door behind her.]\nNed: Oh, she doesn\u2019t know?\nPeter: Nobody knows. I mean, Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that\u2019s it.\nNed: (whispers) Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?\nPeter: (hesitates) Yeah, basically.\nNed: Whoa...\nPeter: You can\u2019t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.\nNed: A secret? Why?\nPeter: You know what she\u2019s like. If she finds out people try and kill me every single night, she\u2019s not going to let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, please.\nNed: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I\u2019ll level with you. I don\u2019t think I can keep this a secret. This is the greatest thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, Peter!\nPeter: Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now, you know? I mean, everything that\u2019s happened with her, I... Please.\nNed: Okay.\nPeter: Just swear it, okay?\nNed: I swear.\nPeter: Thank you.\nNed: Yeah.\n[Peter walks away, running his hands through his hair.]\nPeter: I can\u2019t believe this is happening right now.\nNed: Can I try the suit on?\nPeter: No.\nNed: How does it work? Is it magnets? How do you shoot the strings?\nPeter: I\u2019m gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow, okay?\nNed: Great. Okay, well, wait, then. How do you do this and the Stark internship?\nPeter: This is the Stark internship.\nNed: Oh.\nPeter: Just get out of here.\n[Peter ushers Ned out, leans on the door, and facepalms.]\n[Peter and may are sitting at a small table at Prachya Thai and eating dinner. May tries to make Peter talk, but he looks distracted.]\nMay: What\u2019s the matter? Thought you loved larb. It\u2019s too larby? Not larby enough. How many times do I have to say \u201clarb\u201d before you talk to me? You know I larb you.\nPeter: I\u2019m just stressed. The internship, and I\u2019m tired. A lot of work.\nMay: The Stark internship. I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark. Distracted all the time... he\u2019s got you in your head.\n[A news report on the television behind May catches Peter\u2019s attention.]\nNews Anchor: The beloved Queens\u2019 institution, Delmar\u2019s Sandwiches, was destroyed...\nMay: What does he have you doing?\nNews Anchor: ...in an explosion...\nMay: You need to use your instincts.\n[She becomes quiet as she turns to listen to the news reporter.]\nNews Anchor: ...earlier tonight after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens\u2019 own colorful local crime-stopper, the Spider-Man. As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist, a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street. Miraculously, no one was harmed.\n[Aunt May turns back to Peter with a serious expression.]\nMay: If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way.\nPeter: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.\nMay: Six blocks away from us.\nPeter: I... uh... I need a new backpack.\n[May puts a finger to her ear, disbelief clear on her face.]\nMay: What?\nPeter: I need a new backpack.\nMay: That\u2019s five.\n[A waiter brings a new dish to their table, his eyes glued on May.]\nThai Waiter: Sticky rice pudding.\nMay: Oh, we didn\u2019t order that.\nThai Waiter: It\u2019s on the house.\n[The waiter winks, then leaves.]\nMay: Oh! Thanks. (to Peter) That\u2019s nice of him.\nPeter: I think he larbs you.\n[At Peter\u2019s joke, May points at herself with a exaggerated look of surprise.]\n[The next morning, Peter is walking down the street with Ned, carrying a huge stack of thick books in his arms due to the loss of his backpack.]\nNed: You got bit by a spider? Can it bite me? Well, it probably would\u2019ve hurt, right? You know what? Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I\u2019d let it bite me. Maybe. How much did it hurt?\nPeter: The spider\u2019s dead, Ned.\n[Peter cuts the conversation short, allowing no room for further discussion on the subject. Ned shrugs and looks ahead. His eyes go wide.]\nNed: Whoa.\n[Ned and Peter stop short, examining Delmar\u2019s Sandwiches. It is almost burnt down, the store name almost illegible. Police tape and barricades surround the shop. Various police officers and crime scene investigators are working around it.]\nNed: You were here?\n[Peter warily eyes the agents standing near the scene.]\nPeter: Yeah.\nNed: You could\u2019ve died.\n[The teens stare at the badly damaged building. Expressions completely serious.]\nNed: Do you lay eggs?\nPeter: What? No.\n[Peter laughs at the absurd and anticlimactic suggestion.]\n[In the middle of a chemistry lecture. A torch is boiling a dark-colored liquid on the desk. Peter and Ned are wearing safety glasses. Ned rolls over in his chair toward Peter, who is scribbling in his notebook.]\nNed: (in a low voice) Can you spit venom?\nPeter: No.\nNed: Can you summon an army of spiders?\n[Suppressing a sigh, Peter looks up in the guise of concentrating on the lecture and bends down again to take some notes.]\nPeter: No, Ned.\nHistory Teacher: The Sokovia Accords were put into place...\n[Over Peter\u2019s shoulder, we see a teacher droning on. Ned leans into frame and engages in a whispered conversation with Peter.]\nNed: How far can you shoot your webs?\nPeter: It\u2019s unknown. Shut up.\nHistory Teacher: ...to begin regulating...\nNed: If I was you, I would stand on the edge of a building and just shoot it as far as I could-\nPeter: Shut up, Ned.\n[Peter\u2019s voice rises a little in volume. The girl sitting in front of Peter and Ned turns around and shoots them an irritated glare.]\n[A small, old television is set up beside Coach Wilson, the PE teacher, who is standing with a bored expression. Captain America\u2019s Fitness Challenge is playing on the screen. Captain America, in his full uniform, smiles pleasantly, standing in a locker room.]\nSteve: Hi. I\u2019m Captain America. Whether you\u2019re in the classroom or on the battlefield...\n[Midtown High students are sitting in neat rows on the bleachers, watching Captain America give a speech on screen. We close up on Peter and Ned. Behind them, Michelle is completely engrossed in a book called \u2018Of Human Bondage\u2019.]\nNed: Do you know him too?\nPeter: Yeah, we met.\n[Ned\u2019s eyes widen in awe and his jaw goes slack.]\nSteve: ...fitness can be the difference between success or failure.\nPeter: I stole his shield.\n[Peter boasts, feigning nonchalance. Ned\u2019s jaw drops even more.]\nNed: What?\n[Peter and Ned continue to watch the television with their classmates. We can see Captain over their shoulders.]\nSteve: Today, my good friend, your gym teacher...\n[Captain points to his right. Coach Wilson, who is apparently standing on the wrong side, waves his hand to the students.]\nSteve: ...will be conducting the Captain America Fitness Challenge.\n[He raises his hand in a salute. The screen transitions to \u2018Station I: Sit-ups\u2019.]\nCoach Wilson: Thank you, Captain. I\u2019m pretty sure this guy\u2019s a war criminal now, but whatever. I have to show these videos. It\u2019s required by the state. Let\u2019s do it.\n[Coach Wilson blows his whistle.]\n[Midtown High School students are engaged in various exercises. Climbing ropes, doing chin-ups, push-ups, et cetera. Michelle is lying on a mat by herself and wielding her book like a weight, still immersed in its contents. We travel between students doing sit-ups in pairs.]\nNed: Do Avengers have to pay taxes?\nPeter: Shh!\nNed: What does Hulk smell like?\nPeter: Shh!\nNed: I bet he smells nice.\nPeter: You have to shut up.\nNed: Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?\nPeter: Ned, just, shh, okay?\n[We finally find Peter lying on a mat and doing sit-ups. Ned is holding his legs in place for him.]\nNed: Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?\nPeter: What?\nNed: Yeah. You know how there\u2019s a guy with a headset telling the other guy where to go?\n[Peter\u2019s face contorts into a weird expression. He is still doing sit-ups faster than any other student.]\nNed: Like, like if you\u2019re stuck in a burning building, I could tell you where to go. Because there\u2019d be screens around me, and I could, you know, swivel around, and... \u2018Cause I could be your guy in the chair.\nPeter: Ned, I don\u2019t need a guy in the chair.\nCoach Wilson: Looking good, Parker.\n[The teacher points at Peter as he passes the mat that Peter and Ned are working out on. Peter glances at him, then frowns and takes a huffing breath, trying to look as if the exercise is really taking a toll on him.]\n[On the bleachers, Liz is sitting with a group of friends.]\nBetty: Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor, marry Iron Man, and kill Hulk.\nCharles: Well, what about the Spider-Man?\nBetty: It\u2019s just Spider-Man.\n[When the word \u201cSpider-Man\u201d reaches Peter and Ned\u2019s ears, they stop and turn at the same time to see Liz and her friends.]\nLiz: Did you guys see the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys.\n[Peter\u2019s eyes go wide.]\nBetty: Oh my God, she\u2019s crushing on Spider-Man.\nCharles: No way.\nLiz: (shrugs) Kind of?\nBetty: Ugh, gross.\n[Ned and Peter exchange a look, surprised at the turn of events. Then they look back at Liz and her friends, still listening in on their conversation.]\nBetty: He\u2019s probably like, thirty.\nCharles: You don\u2019t even know what he looks like. Like, what if he\u2019s, like, seriously burned?\nLiz: I wouldn\u2019t care. I would still love him for the person he is on the inside.\nNed: (in a loud voice) Peter knows Spider-Man!\n[Peter looks at Ned, shocked. Mouth comically agape. Everyone in the gym simultaneously drops their assignments and stares at Peter. Peter hurriedly gets up and walks to the bleachers. Ned scrambles to his feet to follow him.]\nPeter: (stuttering) No, I don\u2019t. No. I... I mean...\n[Flash, who was climbing up a rope, slides down to the ground.]\nNed: They\u2019re friends.\nFlash: Yeah, like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends.\nPeter: (stuttering) I\u2019ve met him. Yeah. A couple times. But it\u2019s, um... through the Stark internship. Mm-hmm.\n[Peter turns to Ned, teeth set.]\nPeter: Yeah, well. I\u2019m not really supposed to talk about it.\nFlash: Well, that\u2019s awesome. Hey, you know what? Maybe you should invite him to Liz\u2019s party. Right?\nLiz: Yeah, I\u2019m having people over tonight. You\u2019re more than welcome to come.\nPeter: Having a party?\nFlash: Yeah, it\u2019s gonna be dope. You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man.\nPeter: Um...\nLiz: It\u2019s okay. I know Peter\u2019s way too busy for parties anyway, so...\n[Liz comes to Peter\u2019s rescue, saving Peter from embarrassing himself even further. Flash saunters closer and walks by Peter.]\nFlash: Come on. He\u2019ll be there. Right, Parker?\n[The bell buzzes. Tilting her head toward Peter in a tiny nod of farewell, Liz walks off. Peter, frustrated, throws his hands in the air and swivels to glare at Ned. He moves closer.]\nPeter: What are you doing?\nNed: (in a hushed voice) Helping you out. Did you not hear her? Liz has a crush on you.\n[Peter hesitates, searching for words.]\nNed: Dude, you\u2019re an Avenger. If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it\u2019s you.\n[Ned walks away. Peter stands rooted in place, considering the idea.]\n[May drives Ned and Peter to Liz\u2019s house. Exciting, upbeat music pours out from the house. May slows her car and talks to the boys.]\nMay: House party in the suburbs. Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.\nNed: It\u2019ll be a night to remember.\nMay: (laughs) Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.\nNed: Yeah, it gives me confidence.\nMay: Hmm.\n[Peter is looking out the window, removed from the merry conversation taking place beside him.]\nPeter: This is a mistake. (to May) Hey, let\u2019s just go home.\nMay: Oh, Peter. I know. I know it\u2019s really hard trying to fit in with all the changes your body\u2019s going through. It\u2019s flowering now.\n[The absurd, out-of-place speech makes Peter chuckle.]\nPeter: Uh-huh.\nMay: (to Ned) He\u2019s so stressed out lately.\nNed: What helps with stress is going to a party. We should go to the party.\nPeter: Yeah, let\u2019s do it. Yeah. I\u2019m gonna go. I\u2019m gonna go.\n[Peter opens the car door and steps out.]\nMay: Peter.\n[When Aunt May calls his name, Peter stops and leans in to listen to his aunt through the window. Ned gets out behind them.]\nMay: Have fun, okay?\nPeter: (nods) I will.\nMay: (in a soft voice) Okay.\nNed: Bye, May!\n[Ned waves with a huge grin on his face. Peter closes the door and catches up to him. They approach the house side by side.]\nNed: Dude, you have the suit, right?\n[Peter pulls up his sleeve in order to offer Ned a glimpse of his Spider-Man suit under it.]\nPeter: Yeah.\nNed: This is gonna change our lives.\n[The front door opens, revealing Peter and Ned. They enter the crowded house party and glance around anxiously. Peter looks especially nervous. Two girls pass by in front of them, not taking any interest in their arrival.]\nGirl: Annie, over here!\nAnnie: Hey.\n[Flash is running a DJ station. Ostentatious in headphones and a yellow shirt.]\nMale Voice: DJ Flash!\nNed: Okay. We\u2019re gonna have Spider-Man swing in, say you guys are tight, and then I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.\nMichelle: Can\u2019t believe you guys are at this lame party.\n[Michelle carelessly throws her hair back, trying to act cool. She is in the process of spreading jam on a slice of toast.]\nNed: But you\u2019re here too.\nMichelle: Am I?\n[The toast crunches as Michelle takes a bite out of it and walks away.]\nLiz: Oh, my gosh.\n[When Peter hears Liz\u2019s voice, his eyes go wide. He turns his head towards the sound. Liz walks down the hallway to Peter and Ned.]\nLiz: Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.\nNed: Hi, Liz.\nPeter: Hi, Liz.\n[Peter\u2019s high-pitched and squeaky voice betrays his nervousness.]\nLiz: I\u2019m so happy you guys came. There\u2019s pizza and drinks. Help yourself.\nPeter: What a great party.\nLiz: Thanks.\n[The sound of glass breaking catches their attention.]\nLiz: (sheepish) Oh, I... My parents will kill me if anything\u2019s broken. I gotta-\nPeter: Yeah.\nLiz: Have fun.\nNed: Bye.\nLiz: Bye.\n[Liz walks away.]\nNed: Dude, what are you doing? She\u2019s here. Spider it up.\nPeter: No, no, no. I can\u2019t... I cannot do this. Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I\u2019m just gonna... be myself.\nNed: (sighs) Peter, no one wants that.\nPeter: Dude.\n[Peter starts to walk away, a little bit hurt by the remark.]\nFlash: (into a microphone) Penis Parker, what\u2019s up?\n[Flash plays a honking sound on the stereo system.]\nFlash: So, where\u2019s your pal Spider-Man? Let me guess. In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?\n[Honking noise again. Everyone around them laughs except Peter and Ned.]\nFlash: That\u2019s not Spider-Man. That\u2019s just Ned in a red shirt.\n[The crowd boos and chuckles. Peter frowns, determined.]\n[A shirt drops to the floor and joins the already discarded pairs of jeans and shoes. Peter is standing on a roof. He steps over his clothes, wearing his Spider-Man suit, pulls off his T-shirt. As he mutters to himself, he tries to find a way to make his voice sound different.]\nPeter: Hey, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m Spider-Man. Just thought I\u2019d swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter. Oh, what\u2019s up, Ned? Hey, where\u2019s Peter, anyways? He must be around...\n[Peter sighs, watching the party through glass walls with a discouraged look.]\nPeter: God, this is stupid. What am I doing?\n[Peter spots Ned looking for him. Then something catches his eyes. A bright blue explosion in the distance. He stands, staring at it with concern.]\nPeter: What the hell?\n[Peter runs across the roof and puts on his mask. Shooting webs through trees, he swings down the street.]\n[He lands on another roof, flips off the house, then shoots a thin line of spiderweb over a vast golf course. It flies off, having nothing to attach itself to. Wide shot on Peter running across the golf course. The sprinklers are activated.]\nPeter: (gasping) This sucks!\n[Beside a bridge, we see a discarded car, scraps of metal ripped out from it. A blue ray shoots through the air at a great speed towards it. The car blows up in a huge explosion and makes the shooters cringe in surprise. One of them hoots and laughs as bolts of electricity burst out from the explosion.]\n[Jackson Brice powers down the weapon. The fingers sticking out from the end of the gun curl in on themselves, forming a loose fist.]\nBrice: Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia. Here. You try.\n[Brice hands over the weapon to Aaron Davis, who takes it.]\nAaron: Man, I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man?\n[Behind them, Peter silently crawls down the side of the bridge.]\nBrice: Okay, okay, okay. I got what you need, all right? I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.\n[Hiding, Peter watches as Brice walks up to his van and looks inside. Spider-Man\u2019s eyes narrow. The back of the van is full of machinery and weapons.]\nBrice: Okay, I got, uh, black hole grenades, Chitauri railguns...\nSchultz: You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up. Look, times are changing. We\u2019re the only ones selling these high tech weapons.\nPeter: (whispers) Oh, this must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff.\nAaron: I need something to stick up somebody. I\u2019m not trying to shoot them back in time.\nBrice: I got anti-grav climbers.\nAaron: Yo, climbers?\n[Suddenly, a yodeling ringtone plays. The weapon dealers look around, alarmed.]\nBrice: Okay, what the hell was that?\n[The phone continues to ring. Peter takes his phone out to check caller ID. Ned is making a funny face on the screen. Schultz aims his gun at Aaron.]\nSchultz: Did you set us up?\nAaron: Hey, hey, man.\n[Peter flips off the wall and lands on the ground.]\nPeter: Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.\nSchultz: All right.\n[Schultz turns the gun on Peter, but Peter shoots his web, disarms Schultz, and charges. Using a high tech gauntlet from his van, Brice punches Peter with a burst of energy. Peter slams into the side of the bridge and lands on the ground.]\n[Schultz jumps in and starts the car. Brice, laughing triumphantly, jumps onto the back of the van as his accomplice drives off.]\nPeter: What was that?\n[Peter shoots his web, attaching it to the weapon dealers\u2019 open van door.]\n[The van drags in through a neighborhood, knocking Peter into a trash can.]\nPeter: What? Ah!\n[He shoots a second strand of web.]\nSchultz: We gotta call him.\nBrice: No, no, no, no.\n[Brice readies another high tech weapon. Outside, Peter is holding on with two thin lines of web, trying to maintain balance. Brice fires another burst of energy. It breaks off the van door.]\nSchultz: Did you just do it again?\nBrice: Shut up.\nSchultz: I\u2019m calling him.\n[We see a phone buzzing on a table littered with computer chips and various tools. Mason picks it up. Glancing around, he answers it.]\nMason: Toomes\u2019 phone.\n[He cringes at the sound of combat coming from the other end. Toomes is working nearby, welding something, when Mason calls for him.]\nMason: Boss.\n[Peter is still being dragged through the neighborhood, clinging to the back of the van.]\nPeter: Oh, my butt! Unh!\n[Brice powers more energy blasts at Peter, causing him to lose his grasp on one of the webs. Just as Brice powers up the weapon once more, the van meets a road bump. The whole car wobbles, making Brice accidentally fire a hole in the van. He drops the weapon and it rolls out of the vehicle. The weapons comes to a stop in someone's yard.]\n[Schultz makes a sharp turn, making Peter slam into the side of a parked car. Peter then gets dragged through a line of garbage bins. He hits a solid brick pillar and drops to the ground along with a heap of bricks. Peter\u2019s webs break off. Schultz checks the side mirror. Peter has recovered from the collision. He runs to get a clean shot and extends his hand. The web travels through the air and attaches itself to the remaining van door, but the door breaks off, already weakened by the rough treatment it received. Peter throws his arms up, exasperated.]\nPeter: Great. Guess I\u2019m gonna have to take a shortcut.\n[Peter jogs on the sidewalk, jumps over a tall metal gate, and slides over a parked car. Two men are playing ping-pong in a garage as Peter runs across the yard.]\nPeter: Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.\n[The neighbors stop their game and gape after Spider-Man in disbelief. A dog runs into Peter, barking and standing on its hind legs to lick Peter\u2019s face. Peter retrieves a ball with his web and throws it to the side for the dog.]\nPeter: Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.\n[Peter swings through the neighborhood, hanging on tree branches and streetlights.]\nPeter: Whoo! Now, this is more like it.\n[He glides into another yard. Shooting his web, he accidentally holds onto a treehouse and knocks it off the tree. That makes him lose his grasp and land hard on the roof of a shed. It collapses under his weight.]\nPeter: Whoa, whoa, whoa!\n[After a few awkward banging noises, Peter rips through the door, runs across the yard, and slams through a wooden fence. He leaps into the air only to land on a small toy car, which rolls forward. Losing his balance, Peter gets tangled in a soccer net and stumbles through the hedge.]\nPeter: Whoa.\n[He waves his hand to a man having a barbecue in his own backyard.]\nPeter: Smells really good!\n[\u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off\u201d is playing on the television at a pool party, the sequence closely resembling Peter\u2019s travel through the neighborhood. Suddenly, Peter flies into frame.]\nPeter: Great movie!\n[Peter skims over the pool, splashing water over the partygoers and making them scream in surprise. He then gets tangled in fairy lights and crash lands on another yard, right beside two little girls having a sleepover in a tent. The eyes on his mask malfunction, fluttering open and close in a creepy fashion.]\nPeter: Ugh... Oh, hey, guys.\nTent Kids: Aahhh!\nPeter: No! No!\n[The tent flips over in the girls\u2019 overzealous attempt to escape.]\n[Ned stealthily brings his phone up to his ear, only to reach Peter\u2019s voicemail.]\nPeter: (on recording) Hey, it\u2019s Peter. Leave a message.\n[The phone plays a beeping tone.]\nNed: (whispers) Peter, where are you? The hat\u2019s not working. This is not cool.\n[The van zooms down the suburban street. Smoke is billowing out from the back of it. Peter falls from above, narrowly missing the car.]\nPeter: Almost got you.\n[He knocks over some garbage bins in his attempt to leap up onto a roof. Running across the roofs of neighboring houses, Peter tries his best to keep the van in sight. Slates become loose and fall off the roof under Peter\u2019s feet.]\nPeter: (panting) Thought you got away from me, didn\u2019t you? I got you right where I want you.\n[Finally catching up, Peter jumps toward the van.]\nPeter: Surprise!\n[Suddenly, Vulture snatches him from behind, flying in the wing suit, and soars high. Peter screams, looking down.]\nPeter: What the hell?\n[Peter wrestles to pull his leg free from Vulture\u2019s grasp. Noticing the struggle, Vulture trains his glowing eyes at Peter menacingly and carries him even higher. Suddenly, the spider drawn on the back of Peter\u2019s suit starts to beep and blink. A parachute unfolds itself from the hidden compartment. The air resistance from it makes rips Peter from Vulture\u2019s grasp. During his descent, Peter gets wrapped up in the fabric.]\nPeter: Aahhhh!\n[Peter\u2019s chaotic point of view shows him plunging toward the city.]\n[Peter plunges into a lake. He struggles to free himself from the parachute as he sinks deeper and deeper.]\n[Up above, the surface is calm, not betraying Peter\u2019s desperate fight underwater. A figure dives into the water in an admirably fast speed. Iron Man emerges, carrying Peter. Holding him under his arms. Peter\u2019s head hang slumped. The eyes on his mask blink open.]\nPeter: Huh? Oh, hey.\n[Peter wrings his mask. Water drips from it. He is sitting on a jungle gym. In front of him, Iron Man is floating in the air.]\nPeter: And then he just, he just, like, swooped down like a monster and he picked me up and, uh, he took me up, like, a thousand feet and just dropped me. How\u2019d you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?\nTony: I put everything in your suit. Including this heater.\nPeter: Whoa!\n[The suit is dried instantly. Steam rises from it, surrounding Peter.]\nPeter: Whew, that\u2019s better. Thanks.\n[Peter shivers, his teeth chattering.]\nTony: What were you thinking?\nPeter: The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.\nTony: Take him down now, huh? Steady, Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing.\nPeter: The Avengers?\nTony: No, no, no. This is a little below their pay grade.\nPeter: Anyway, Mr. Stark, you didn\u2019t have to come all the way out here. I had that. I was fine.\nTony: Oh, I\u2019m not here.\n[Iron Man\u2019s helmet opens, revealing an empty space where Tony\u2019s face should have been.]\n[We are in India. Tony is dressed in a white kurta and wearing a red scarf around his neck. Behind him, Indian women in saris and garlands are participating in a traditional wedding.]\nTony: Thank God this place has Wi-Fi or you would be toast right now. Thank Ganesh while you\u2019re at it.\n[A man brings Tony a drink. Tony makes a small toast, whispering his gratitude.]\nTony: Cheers.\n[Tony continues to talk through the empty suit, his helmet still open.]\nTony: Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.\nPeter: Why?\nTony: Why? Because I said so!\n[A woman walks to him. Tony demurely bends down in order to help her put a flower garland around his neck.]\nTony: Sorry, I\u2019m talking to a teenager. (to Peter) Stay close to the ground. Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro. Can\u2019t you just be a friendly...\n[Tony takes a sip from his drink and puts it down with a clink.]\nTony: ...neighborhood Spider-Man?\nPeter: But I\u2019m ready for more than that now.\nTony: No, you are not.\n[The empty Iron Man suit closes.]\nPeter: That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.\nTony: Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would\u2019ve. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy.\n[Peter hears a car engine revving.]\nPeter: Are you driving?\n[Tony gets in his car and shuts the door.]\nTony: You know, it\u2019s never too early to start thinking about college. I got some pull at MIT. (at his phone) End call.\n[Tony drives off in his yellow Audi.]\nPeter: No, I don\u2019t need to go to col- Mr. Stark-\nFriday: Mr. Stark is no longer connected.\n[The Iron Man suit flies off. Peter mutters grudgingly.]\nPeter: That\u2019s awesome.\n[Peter approaches an empty yard, wearing his mask again.]\nPeter: (mutters) Stay close to the ground? What is he talking about?\n[He stops walking, spotting something. Peter enters the yard and finds a piece of Brice\u2019s damaged weapon that had fallen out of the vehicle. He crouches down to tentatively flip it over with his fingertips.]\nPeter: Whoa.\n[Peter finds the glowing energy core. His phone rings. Peter answers a call from Ned.]\nPeter: Hey, man, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m on my way back.\nNed: Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn\u2019t come. Listen to this.\n[Ned pulls his phone off his ear and raises it into the air.]\nFlash: When I say \u201cpenis,\u201d you say \u201cParker.\u201d Penis!\nCrowd: Parker!\nFlash: Penis!\nCrowd: Parker!\n[Peter can still hear Flash and his friends chanting in the background.]\nNed: Sorry, Peter. I guess we\u2019re still losers. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\nPeter: I\u2019ll see you tomorrow in school.\n[Peter hangs up and carefully lifts the weapon. Metal and wires encase the glowing core. Peter looks up, determination clear on his masked face.]\n[In Toomes' warehouse, Mason is working on a small device which is glowing with a purple hue similar to the core of Peter\u2019s discovery. He blows on the end of the soldering tool and picks up a glowing cube. Mason throws the cube into a refrigerator, creating a rectangular portal. He reaches through it and grabs a drink.]\nMason: Whoa, whoa.\n[The room shakes, making the cube parts fall off the refrigerator and closing the small opening. Toomes lands on the platform in his vulture suit. Stepping out of the suit, he walks down the stairs, stomping angrily.]\nToomes: Idiots. Idiots.\n[He throws his helmet.]\nToomes: Idiots!\n[A worker looks up at Vulture, alarmed.]\nMason: Boss. Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light?\n[Vulture approaches Mason.]\nToomes: What\u2019d I tell you about looking at my phone?\nMason: Oh, sorry. You left it out. You know I\u2019m a curious person by nature.\n[Toomes takes the phone.]\nMason: I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.\nToomes: Huh?\nMason: In case you want to, you know, go for the big one?\nToomes: You\u2019re still on that? I told you, no. The answer\u2019s no. Forget it.\n[The badly damaged van pulls into the warehouse. Vulture and Mason look at it curiously. Brice appears from the back of the van, not bothering to open the nonexistent doors which got ripped out during their fight with Spider-Man.]\nBrice: Whoo!\n[Smiling, Brice takes off his hand-weapon and reaches Vulture.]\nBrice: I mean, that was badass.\n[Annoyed, Toomes walks toward Brice.]\nToomes: How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open?\nBrice: You said, move the merchandise.\nToomes: Under the radar. Under the radar! That\u2019s how we survive. If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we\u2019re through. You\u2019re out there wearing that goofy thing, lightning up cars, calling yourself the Shocker. \u201cI\u2019m the Shocker. I shock people.\u201d What is this, pro wrestling?\nBrice: Ah, whatever, old man. Come on.\n[Brice walks to a table and Vulture follows.]\nToomes: Look, look. I know you don\u2019t give a crap about anything. But I do. I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after.\nBrice: (mockingly) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n[Vulture stares at Brice, his expression cold.]\nToomes: You know what? I can\u2019t afford your bullshit. Get out of here.\nBrice: What?\nToomes: You\u2019re done. You\u2019re off the crew.\nBrice: Yeah, all right. All right. Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right? With everything I know.\n[Brice walks off.]\nToomes: Excuse me?\nBrice: Um, I\u2019m just saying...\n[Vulture looks at Brice, properly annoyed.]\nBrice: ...maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.\nToomes: You know what?\nBrice: What?\nToomes: You\u2019re right. (to Mason, in a low voice) That work?\nMason: I don\u2019t know.\n[Vulture looks at Brice again.]\nToomes: I can\u2019t afford that.\n[Vulture picks up and fires the high-tech weapon which Mason was working on. A blue ray zaps Brice, burning him down to ashes. Brice\u2019s gauntlet clatters to the ground. The weapon powers down. Vulture looks on, a little confused. Schultz eyes the ashes.]\nSchultz: Damn.\n[Still confused, Vulture speaks to Mason.]\nToomes: I thought this was the antigravity gun.\nMason: What? No, that\u2019s that one.\n[Mason points to another weapon. Dropping the weapon on the worktable, Vulture approaches Brice\u2019s remains. He picks up the Shocker\u2019s gauntlet and cleans off the ashes. He then tosses the gauntlet to Schultz.]\nToomes: Here. Now you\u2019re the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost.\nSchultz: All right.\n[Vulture walks off.]\n[In shop class, Peter hits the weapon core casing with a hammer. The core emits purple light as it is partially freed from the metal casing.]\nPeter: Oh.\n[He starts to pull it apart. Ned joins him.]\nNed: Hey, thanks for bailing on me.\nPeter: Yeah, well, something came up.\n[Ned spots the glowing core.]\nNed: Oh, what is that?\n[Peter struggles to take the machine apart.]\nPeter: I don\u2019t know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.\nNed: Seriously?\nPeter: Yeah.\nNed: Awesome.\n[Peter looks at Ned at the absurd reaction.]\nNed: I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy. So scary.\n[Peter gives Ned a look and continues to work at the casing.]\nPeter: Well, look, I think it\u2019s a power source.\nNed: Yeah, but it\u2019s connected to all these microprocessors. That\u2019s an inductive charging plate. That\u2019s what I use to charge my toothbrush.\n[Ned points at a complex-looking charging mechanism connected to various wires.]\nPeter: Whoever\u2019s making these weapons is obviously combining alien tech with ours.\nNed: That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said. I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey into this amazing-\n[Peter is not listening to a word he\u2019s saying. He brings up a hammer and hits the core really hard. The core pops out from its place, glowing. Peter and Ned immediately look at the teacher. The teacher is reading a book, sitting in his chair. He does not even spare a glance at the commotion they are causing.]\nMr. Hapgood: Keep your fingers clear of the blades.\n[Peter and Ned turn back and look at the core which popped out.]\nPeter: I gotta figure out what this thing is and who makes it.\nNed: We\u2019ll go to the lab after class and run some tests.\n[We see the core glowing on the table.]\nPeter: Let\u2019s do it.\n[Peter and Ned share a complicated secret handshake.]\n[Peter and Ned are walking down the hallway.]\nNed: First, I say we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer.\nPeter: First, we gotta come up with a better name than \u201cglowy thingy.\u201d\nNed: You\u2019re right.\n[Schultz and Randy walk in. Peter spots them and freezes instantly.]\nPeter: Crap.\n[He throws himself behind a wall.]\nPeter: (whispers) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.\n[Ned looks around, then shuffles across the corridor to join Peter by a classroom window. Behind them, the chess club is peacefully playing a game. Peter peers around the corner.]\nSchultz: High schools creep me out.\n[Peter and Ned peer at them.]\nSchultz: They got this funny smell, you know?\n[Peter and Ned hide behind the wall again. They carry out a whispered conversation.]\nPeter: Hey, that\u2019s one of the guys that tried to kill me.\nNed: What?\nPeter: Yeah.\nNed: We gotta get out of here.\nPeter: No, no, no, no, no. I gotta follow them. Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake.\nNed: Someone dropped you in a lake?\nPeter: Yeah, it was not good.\n[Schultz and Randy enter a classroom.]\nNed: (whispers) Peter-\nPeter: (whispers) No. Stay there, Ned.\n[Peter raises an arm to stop Ned and sneaks away.]\nNed: (whispers) Peter.\n[Ned is left standing alone. Through the window, Brian \"Tiny\" McKeever notices him. He knocks on the window, making Ned turn around, startled.]\nTiny: What are you doing?\nNed: (in a normal voice) Nothing.\n[Down the hall, Peter is trailing the two men. Ned tries to act nonchalant.]\nTiny: Oh.\nNed: Yeah. You good?\nTiny: Chess.\n[Peter sneaks down a staircase into the classroom. Schultz and Randy are rummaging through the room.]\nRandy: Can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were?\nSchultz: It\u2019s saying there was an energy pulse right here.\n[Peter slowly walks down the stairs and takes off his bag.]\nRandy: There\u2019s no sign of the weapon. And even if it was here, now it\u2019s gone.\nSchultz: So are we.\n[Schultz looks in Peter\u2019s direction. We see no one there. An upside-down chair standing on the table shakes a little. Spotting the anomaly, Schultz gets closer, putting his hand on his gun. He crosses the room and pauses by the worktable, scanning the area. As the men head out, we tilt down to reveal Peter clinging under the table. He shoots a tiny robotic spider at one of the men\u2019s shoes. It stealthily climbs up the man\u2019s leg.]\n[Sitting in Peter's room, Ned holds the web-shooter. It projects a hologram model of the city. Peter hops onto the bed next to Ned.]\nNed: This is so awesome.\nPeter: I know, right?\n[Ned pokes it and the model becomes more defined.]\nPeter: They\u2019re in Brooklyn.\n[Later. Ned is still studying the hologram and Peter is hanging upside down, eating chips.]\nNed: Staten Island.\n[Night has fallen. Ned lies on the floor while Peter works at his desk. Ned glances at the hologram.]\nNed: Leaving Jersey.\n[With a shooter, Peter projects a characterized image of his mask on the wall.]\n[Later. Ned now lies on the bed. The hologram model starts to beep. Startled, he sits up, wearing the Spider-Man mask. He grabs the hologram model next to him.]\nNed: They stopped.\n[Peter pops into frame, hanging from the ceiling. He turns around, a little groggy, and eyes the model.]\nPeter: Maryland?\nNed: What\u2019s there?\nPeter: I don\u2019t know. Evil lair?\nNed: They have a lair?\nPeter: Dude. A gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings? Yeah, they have a lair.\nNed: (nods) Badass. But how are you gonna get there if it\u2019s, like, 300 miles away?\n[They simultaneously turn to face the Academic Decathlon poster.]\nPeter: It\u2019s not too far from D.C.\n[Midtown High students are waiting by a yellow bus, dressed in their yellow uniform jackets. Peter runs toward them.]\nAbe: Hey, it\u2019s Peter.\nPeter: Guys.\nLiz: Peter?\nFriend: Hey, buddy.\nPeter: Yeah, I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team.\n[Flash, standing in the back, walks forward to face Peter.]\nFlash: No, no way. You can\u2019t just quit on us, stroll up, and be welcomed back by everyone.\n[The teacher walks out of the bus.]\nMr. Harrington: Hey, welcome back, Peter. Flash, you\u2019re back to first alternate.\nFlash: What?\nAbe: He\u2019s taking your place.\n[Michelle appears behind them, sans uniform.]\nMichelle: Excuse me, can we go already? \u2018Cause I was hoping to get in some light protesting in front of one of the embassies before dinner, so.\nMr. Harrington: Protesting is patriotic. Let\u2019s get on the bus.\n[Flash shrugs off his jacket and sullenly thrusts it into Peter\u2019s arms.]\n[The bus is travelling through the highway. 90 miles to Baltimore, 126 miles to Washington.]\nLiz: Focus up, everyone. Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.\n[The students are holding bells, focusing on Liz\u2019s quiz. They ring their bells before answering.]\nCindy: The second law of thermodynamics.\nCharles: Frank Sinatra.\nFlash: Fort Sumter.\nAbe: Flash is wrong.\nLiz: Okay, guys, let\u2019s focus. Next one.\nMr. Harrington: Liz, don\u2019t overwork them.\nPeter: Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium.\nLiz: Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.\nPeter: Glad to be back.\n[Peter\u2019s phone vibrates. He takes it out to see that Happy is calling him.]\nLiz: What is the current standard unit of radioactive-\nPeter: Can I take this real quick? I\u2019ll only be a sec.\nLiz: Yeah, fine.\n[Peter answers his call, moving to the back seats. As he passes by, Michelle stares at him curiously, looking up from her book.]\nPeter: Hello?\n[Happy is talking on the phone in the Avengers Tower. Behind him, workers are carrying things.]\nHappy: Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York?\n[Decathlon practice continues in the background.]\nLiz: Okay, focus up, everyone.\nPeter: Tracker.\n[Peter holds the phone away from his mouth and mutters.]\nPeter: (in a normal voice) Uh, yeah. No, it\u2019s just a school trip. It\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s nothing.\n[Peter sits in the back of the bus, next row to Ned.]\nPeter: Look, Happy, I gotta say, you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy.\n[Ned points at the hologram model.]\nPeter: (whispers) That\u2019s different.\n[Happy looks suspicious.]\nHappy: What\u2019s different?\nPeter: Nothing. Look, it\u2019s just the Academic Decathlon. It\u2019s no big deal.\nHappy: Hey, hey. I\u2019ll decide if it\u2019s no big deal.\n[Peter looks annoyed. He mouths, \u201cwhat?\u201d]\nHappy: Sounds like it\u2019s no big deal, but remember, I\u2019m watching you.\n[The bus approaches Washington D.C. Above the hotel entrance, we see a banner announcing the \u201cUnited States Academic Decathlon.\u201d]\n[The Decathlon team arrives in the check-in area. We see the interior of the hotel which is filled with preparations for the Decathlon. The students and teacher look on in awe as they walk in. Liz is at their front, leading everyone.]\nLiz: Everyone stick together.\nMr. Harrington: Yeah.\nCharles: You kidding me? This place is huge.\nFlash: I\u2019ve seen bigger.\nAbe: There\u2019s a bird in here.\nPeter: (to Ned) Hey, you brought your laptop, right?\nNed: Why?\n[The door to Peter and Ned's hotel room closes. The do not disturb sign is hanging on its handle. Peter and Ned unpack, shaking various belongings like wires, the purple weapon core, toothpaste, and braces out of their backpacks. Peter connects a wire to the suit. Ned is using his laptop, complicated lines of codes flashing through the screen. Peter holds a flashlight with his mouth, working on his suit.]\nNed: Peter, why are we removing the tracker from your suit?\nPeter: Uh, because I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again and I don\u2019t really want Mr. Stark to know about it.\nNed: So you\u2019re lying to Iron Man now?\nPeter: No, I\u2019m not lying. He just doesn\u2019t really get what I can do yet.\n[Ned warily eyes his friend. Peter removes the tracking device from the suit.]\nPeter: Ah... Gotcha.\n[He takes the flashlight out of his mouth.]\nPeter: All right, Happy. Enjoy tracking this lamp.\n[Peter sticks the device on a lamp, then gets back to the suit. Ned is still working on the laptop.]\nNed: There\u2019s a ton of other subsystems in here...\nPeter: Hmm?\nNed: (smirks) ...but they\u2019re all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol.\nPeter: What?\n[Peter hops up next to Ned and looks at the screen. The words \u201cTraining Wheels Protocol\u201d are written in red. The codes declare that the protocol is currently active and that \u201cStark Industry Key Identifier\u201d should be entered to disable it.]\nPeter: \u201cTraining Wheels Protocol?\u201d\n[Ned chuckles.]\nPeter: Turn it off.\nNed: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. I mean, they\u2019re probably blocked for a reason.\nPeter: Come on, man. I don\u2019t need training wheels.\n[Peter steps onto his bed and jumps up and down.]\nPeter: I\u2019m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time. It\u2019s not cool.\nNed: But you are a kid.\nPeter: Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.\nNed: Peter, I just don\u2019t think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?\n[Peter jumps down to kneel beside Ned.]\nPeter: Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself. I can handle it. Ned, come on.\nNed: I really don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\nPeter: (whispers) The guy in the chair.\nNed: Don\u2019t do that.\nPeter: Come on.\n[Ned sighs and types reluctantly. A blue flash of light briefly pulses through the suit. Peter and Ned look at it.]\n[Peter, wearing the suit without the mask, zips up his sweat shirt to hide it and puts on his hood. He peeks out the door and looks around. The corridors are quiet and empty.]\nPeter: Yeah, the glowy thing, it\u2019s evidence. Keep it safe.\n[Ned picks up the glowing core.]\nPeter: All right?\nNed: Okay, okay.\n[Peter activates the tracker.]\nPeter: They\u2019re moving.\n[Peter hurriedly walks out of the room.]\nNed: Be careful.\n[As Peter tries to walk down the hall unnoticed, Liz approaches in a bathing suit.]\nPeter: Hey, Liz.\nLiz: (whispers) Perfect timing. We\u2019re gonna go swimming. Come on, come on, come on.\n[She waves the other students forward.]\nPeter: (whispers) What?\n[The teenagers sneak by, laughing quietly.]\nSally: Hey, Peter.\nCindy: Hi.\n[Flash slaps Peter\u2019s butt.]\nPeter: Hey!\n[Peter squeals in a high tone, offended.]\nPeter: I was, uh... I was gonna go study, um, in the business center.\nLiz: Peter, you don\u2019t need to study. You\u2019re, like, the smartest guy I\u2019ve ever met.\n[Peter looks at Liz, bewitched.]\nLiz: And besides... Um, a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale.\nPeter: Hmm?\nLiz: Um, well, I read that in a TED Talk, so, I-I heard it in a TED Talk. And I read a coaching book.\n[Liz smiles and nods.]\nPeter: Wow, you really... This is really important to you.\nLiz: Yeah. It\u2019s our future. I\u2019m not gonna screw it up. Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, eleven dollars. So get your trunks on and come on.\n[Liz throws a candy bar at Peter in a smooth arc.]\nCharles: Come on.\nSally: Come on.\nLiz: I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming.\n[Liz catches up with the others.]\n[At an indoor swimming pool, the Decathlon teammates swim. Liz sits on a wall between the pool and a spa.]\n[Wearing his suit without the mask, Peter watches Liz through a window on the roof. Liz playfully chats with her teammates. Peter sighs. Stepping back from the window, he tightens the straps on his backpack. Peter puts on the mask. A brief glow expands from the spider emblem on his chest.]\nSuit Lady: Good evening, Peter.\nPeter: Hello? Hello?\nSuit Lady: Congratulations on completing the rigorous Training Wheels Protocol and gaining access to your suit\u2019s full capabilities.\n[We see Peter\u2019s view from inside the spider suit, quickly changing to different view modes.]\nPeter: Ah, thank you.\nSuit Lady: So where would you like to take me tonight?\nPeter: (stuttering) S, I, I, put a tracker on someone. He\u2019s a bad guy.\nSuit Lady: Tracker located.\n[We see the spider suit tracking down the path that leads to the guy Peter is after.]\nSuit Lady: Plotting course to intercept target.\nPeter: Okay, well, as long as I make it back in time for Decathlon, it\u2019s fine.\n[Peter swings from a web and lands on a truck. As the truck runs past, we see a banner that says \u201cUnited States Academic Decathlon.\u201d]\n[Peter rides on a different truck, raging down the road. We see Peter in his spider suit crouching on top of the truck, with the dark night sky in the background.]\nSuit Lady: One hundred meters from destination and closing.\n[The truck roars past a patch of grass.]\nSuit Lady: Jump now.\n[Peter leaps off the truck and rolls down a grassy bank. He runs across the bank through the tall grass, approaching an abandoned gas station.]\nSuit Lady: Detecting three individuals.\n[We see Peter observing the gas station from behind his back. The station is dark, with a couple of trucks in its driveway. He stops and crouches to observe the gas station.]\nPeter: (whispers) Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That\u2019s so lame.\n[Peter jumps, and climbs on top of the empty gas price sign.]\nPeter: Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?\nSuit Lady: Do you want to hear what they\u2019re saying?\nPeter: I can hear what they\u2019re saying? Uh, yeah.\nSuit Lady: Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.\n[The spider suit display closes in on the van and shows Peter the heat signals emitted from the men inside. There are three people in the van who are quietly speaking.]\nMason: I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup. The rest is all my design.\nPeter: Whoa, that\u2019s so cool.\nRandy: Can\u2019t believe they\u2019re still cleaning up that Triskelion mess.\nSchultz: I love it. They keep making messes, we keep getting rich.\nMason: Target inbound.\nPeter: Whoa, they\u2019re in the middle of a heist. I could catch them all red-handed. This is awesome. Okay, I\u2019m gonna get a little closer so I can see what\u2019s happening.\nSuit Lady: Would you like me to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?\nPeter: Uh, Enhanced Combat Mode? Yeah.\nSuit Lady: Activating Instant Kill.\n[The eyes of Peter\u2019s spider suit turn into evil-looking tiny red dots.]\nPeter: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want to kill anybody!\nSuit Lady: Deactivating Instant Kill.\n[The eyes switch back to their normal width and color. Peter jumps off the sign and falls on his face on the hard asphalt ground. Peter grunts.]\nSchultz: Did you hear that?\nPeter: What the hell just happened? What was that?\nSuit Lady: You jumped off the sign and landed on your face.\n[He fires web pellets from his shooter which land on the gas station sign.]\nPeter: Suit lady, what\u2019s wrong with my web-shooters?\n[Peter runs to hide behind a sign.]\nSuit Lady: Rapid-fire is the default for Enhanced Combat Mode.\nPeter: Why would I need rapid-fire?\nSuit Lady: Would you like to see more options?\n[We see Peter\u2019s hands from his spider suit point of view. All kinds of webs are shown from which he can choose.]\nSuit Lady: You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.\nPeter: Whoa, Mr. Stark really overdid it.\n[Inside the car:]\nSchultz: You two wait right here.\nMason: Wait. You\u2019re gonna want to turn on the dampers, though, or that thing will shatter your arm.\nSchultz: All right. Where\u2019s the dampers?\n[Peter is still looking down at all the options for his webs displayed over his hands.]\nPeter: That one.\nSuit Lady: Great choice.\n[One of the options turn red.]\nSuit Lady: Would you like me to set this as your new default?\n[Peter shoots an electrified web at a neon sign, making it blink on and off.]\nPeter: No, no, no.\n[Through the window, we see Peter struggling with his electrified webs. He keeps shooting, and the neon sign keeps flashing. The men in the car are oblivious.]\nMason: Push that in.\nSchultz: Right here?\nMason: No, no, the other-\nSchultz: This one right here?\nMason: Yeah, push.\n[Peter runs behind the gas station, away from the truck, and leaps on some trucks to reach the roof of the building.]\nPeter: What was that?\nSuit Lady: Taser webs.\nPeter: Taser webs? I don\u2019t want taser webs.\nSuit Lady: You seem to be very unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings. Would you like to run a refresher course?\n[Peter sits on the roof to get a better look at the men.]\nPeter: No, just... You choose.\nSuit Lady: Sure thing.\n[Inside the DODC convoy truck:]\nDODC Central: Six-Alpha-Niner. Are you running on time?\nDODC Driver: Copy, Central. Six-Alpha-Niner on schedule.\n[Schultz, Vulture\u2019s bald henchman, peers through binoculars. Three trucks are approaching the gas station.]\nSchultz: I have visual.\nMason: Green light, green light.\n[Peter spots Vulture flying overhead in his wing suit.]\nPeter: Oh, that\u2019s him.\n[Vulture soars over a convoy of transport trucks. The suit\u2019s eyes glow green in the dark.]\nVulture: Okay, I got eyes on the convoy. Pulling in behind the caboose.\nMason: Deploy anchors.\n[Vulture fires cables onto the roof of the last truck. He drops a cube onto the trailer, which separates into four pieces. Arranged in a rectangle, they create a glowing portal through the roof.]\nVulture: Dropping down.\n[Vulture detaches from his suit and falls through the portal, but the truck driver seems unaware of what\u2019s happening.]\n[Inside the van, Mason speaks into his walkie-talkie, surrounded by wires and screens.]\nMason: No outgoing distress signals. You\u2019re all clear.\n[We see Vulture\u2019s green-filtered view of the inside of the trailer. Cage-like boxes contain exotic items.]\nVulture: Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here.\n[He rips off the door from a cage full of tech. Peter climbs on top of the trailer and touches the portal. His fingers go through.]\nPeter: Whoa, cool. It\u2019s some kind of matter phase shifter.\n[Peter crawls down the ceiling as Vulture rises into view. Vulture kneels and zips a duffel bag.]\nVulture: Alright, coming up.\n[Vulture jumps through the portal and onto the roof of the trailer. Peter shoots a web at Vulture\u2019s bag, pulling it away.]\nPeter: Hey, Big Bird! This doesn\u2019t belong to you!\n[Vulture\u2019s green eyes glare intimidatingly in Peter\u2019s direction.]\nPeter: Oh, god.\n[Vulture gets into his wing suit and soars toward Peter. Peter jumps over him and fires long, weak webs past Vulture.]\nPeter: Suit lady, what was that?\nSuit Lady: You told me to choose.\n[Vulture attacks Peter and Peter tries to balance himself on the edge of the trailer.]\nPeter: What? No, just set everything back to normal.\n[Peter grabs Vulture\u2019s duffel bag, and starts to tug.]\nSuit Lady: Activating all systems.\n[Peter rips the bag out of Vulture\u2019s talons. He falls through the portal back into the truck. The portal cube is thrown off position by Peter\u2019s movement. He immediately jumps up to get out but slams his head on the now solid roof. Peter loses consciousness. Cut to black.]\n[Time seems to have passed, and Peter lies motionless on the floor of the trailer. The truck shakes to a stop, waking Peter up.]\nPeter: Oh, my head.\nSuit Lady: You appear to have a mild concussion.\n[With a headache, Peter stands up with a hand to his head.]\nPeter: Hey, so where am I right now?\n[Peter looks around, but cannot figure out where he is.]\nSuit Lady: I\u2019m not sure. The container walls are hindering my sensors.\nPeter: Wait a minute. They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair. Okay, suit lady. We\u2019re gonna have to fight our way out of this one.\n[Peter prepares himself to burst through the truck\u2019s metal doors.]\nPeter: Three, two, one!\n[Peter smashes through the trailer doors, and finds himself in a huge warehouse full of containers. He looks around, on guard.]\nPeter: What is this place? Suit lady, where am I?\nSuit Lady: You\u2019re in the most secure facility on the Eastern Seaboard. The Damage Control Deep Storage Vault.\nPeter: No. Seriously?\n[Shocked, Peter puts both hands to his head. On the wall before him, \u201cDODC-V05\u201d is written in big black letters.]\n[Time has passed. Peter is clinging to the horizontal crack of the massive doors as he tries to wedge them open.]\nSuit Lady: The door will most likely remain closed until morning.\n[Peter kicks at the bottom of the doors.]\nPeter: (disappointed) Morning?\n[Later. Peter is lying on a hammock made out of his webs.]\nPeter: Hey, suit lady, I kind of feel bad calling you \u201csuit lady,\u201d you know? I think I should probably give you a name... like Liz. No, no, no. God, that\u2019s... that\u2019s weird.\n[With one hand, Peter swings on a rope that is also made out of his webs, and lets go, dropping to the floor and lying down.]\nPeter: What about Karen?\nSuit Lady: You can call me Karen if you would like.\n[Peter reads a book hanging upside down. His web is held between his feet and suspending him from the ceiling.]\nPeter: Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?\n[Wings expand from under his arms. Peter gasps in surprise.]\nPeter: What?\n[Standing in front of an empty wall, Peter is now wearing his yellow Midtown high school blazer over his suit. The suit is flashing a laser spider man emblem on the wall. Peter is examining the options for his web.]\nPeter: Maybe we should run that refresher course.\nKaren: Ricochet web.\nPeter: Ricochet web.\n[Peter shoots a ricochet web on the wall and it immediately bounces back. He ducks to dodge the ball-shaped bundle of web.]\nPeter: Whoa! Cool.\n[Later. The wall is covered with patches of spiderwebs now.]\nKaren: Splitter web.\n[Peter fires two strands of web.]\n[More time has passed. The wall is even messier.]\nKaren: Web grenade.\n[Peter jumps, and throws a small, metal-like ball of web.]\nPeter: Web grenade!\n[The web grenade explodes, and the web covers the wall even more.]\n[Later. Peter jump ropes with a strand of web.]\n[Later. Peter is lying face up on one of the trailers.]\nPeter: Should I tell Liz that I\u2019m Spider-Man?\nKaren: Who is Liz?\nPeter: Who is Liz? She\u2019s.. heh. She\u2019s the best. She\u2019s awesome. She, uh, she\u2019s just a girl who goes to my school. And, uh... Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her, but it\u2019s kind of weird, you know? \u201cHey, I\u2019m... I\u2019m Spider-Man.\u201d\nKaren: What\u2019s weird about that?\nPeter: What if she\u2019s expecting someone like Tony Stark? I mean, imagine how disappointed she\u2019d be when she sees me.\nKaren: Well, if I were her, I wouldn\u2019t be disappointed at all.\nPeter: Thanks, Karen. It\u2019s really nice to have somebody to talk to. Hey, how long we been here anyways?\nKaren: Thirty seven minutes.\nPeter: What? Thirty seven minutes?\n[Peter sits up, unable to control the frustration.]\nPeter: That\u2019s insane. I cannot take this anymore. I gotta... I gotta get out of here.\n[Peter flips off a container and walks into it. He sighs and takes off his blazers and his hoodie.]\nPeter: There\u2019s got to be something in here I can use.\n[He opens Vulture\u2019s duffel bag.]\nPeter: Okay, let\u2019s see.\n[Peter inspects a wheel-shaped metal piece then throws it away.]\nPeter: Nope.\n[He pulls out a Ultron head.]\nPeter: That\u2019s awesome.\n[The Ultron head makes a clanging sound as it is discarded on the floor. Peter holds a purple glowing object.]\nPeter: Ah, hey, it\u2019s like the glowy thing.\nKaren: That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.\nPeter: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You mean, we\u2019ve been carrying around a bomb?\nKaren: It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.\n[Peter finds his phone and tries to call Ned but can\u2019t get any reception.]\nPeter: No, no, no, no, no.\n[Peter uses webs to swing to the warehouse doors. Clinging onto the doors, he starts banging and shouting, hoping someone would hear him.]\nPeter: Hey! Please! Please, somebody, let me out! Hey! Karen, you have to help me override that time lock.\n[Peter hangs upside down from the ceiling next to the time lock close to the doors. He has opened the lock panel and is now putting in numbers. In his hands are a notepad and a pen.]\nPeter: Okay Karen. Lower the voltage and run it.\nKaren: Trial unsuccessful.\nPeter: Okay, we\u2019re just gonna have to try every sequence.\n[Peter crosses out the wrong sequence on his notepad.]\n[The sun is rising over the Washington D.C.]\n[At the hotel, Ned waits in his room. Someone knocks on the door.]\nStudent: Ned, Peter, we\u2019re gonna be late. Come on, let\u2019s go.\nNed: Okay, hold on, hold on.\n[Ned grabs the energy core.]\n[Peter is still trying to override the lock. He yawns, then presses some buttons.]\nKaren: Initiating trial 247.\n[The massive warehouse doors groan as they open.]\nPeter: It worked! It works!\n[Peter swings out on his webs through the opening doors. Peter crawls on the ceiling outside, then drops on the trailer of a departing truck. He lies down as the truck passes an armed guard.]\n[The students are entering the Decathlon venue.]\nModerator: Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.\n[Ned hand his phone in to the security.]\nSecurity: Thank you.\n[Peter is standing on the back of a trailer truck. A ringing tone is heard in the background.]\nPeter: Karen, you have to get me to Decathlon as fast as possible.\nKaren: Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.\nPeter: Right across the street from the Washington Monument.\n[We see Peter holding his phone to his ear.]\nNed: Hey, it\u2019s Ned. Leave a message.\nPeter: Ned, call me back! The glowy thing is a bomb!\n[At the Decathlon, the students are scribbling. We pan down to see the purple energy core glowing in Ned\u2019s pocket.]\nKaren: There\u2019s a vehicle approaching on your right.\n[Peter grunts, and climbs on top of the cargo.]\nModerator: We have now entered sudden death.\n[The students prepare themselves, trying to be calm and placing their hands on their buzzers. Flash takes a deep breath, clearly nervous.]\n[The scene cuts over to Peter as he leaps on a SUV.]\nModerator: The next correct answer wins the championship.\n[Michelle hits the answer bell with a bored, impassive look.]\nModerator: Midtown Tech?\nMichelle: Zero.\nModerator: That is correct. Midtown takes the championship!\n[Ned hugs Michelle and she smiles. More Midtown students pile in for a group hug.]\n[The Midtown High students are walking toward the Washington Monument.]\nStudent: We won!\nLiz: You guys, I am so proud of you.\nFlash: Told you we didn\u2019t need Peter.\nNed: Flash, you didn\u2019t answer a single question.\n[Michelle is standing alone with a book.]\nMr. Harrington: Taking it all in, Michelle?\nMichelle: Oh, yeah, I just... um, I don\u2019t really want to celebrate something that was built by slaves.\nMr. Harrington: Oh, I\u2019m sure the Washington Monument wasn\u2019t built by-\n[Mr. Harrington looks up at the monument. A park ranger wobbles his hand as a confirmation to Michelle\u2019s words. Mr. Harrington purses his lips and walks away.]\nMr. Harrington: Okay. Enjoy your book.\nMichelle: Thanks.\n[Peter swings on top of a bus. Peter and Ned finally reach each other on the phone.]\nPeter: Oh, Ned, you\u2019re alive!\n[Ned is at the Washington Monument, about to get a security check.]\nNed: (whispers) Peter, are you okay?\nPeter: Ned, Ned, where\u2019s the glowy thing, the glowy thing?\nNed: Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s in my backpack.\n[Ned puts his backpack down on the conveyor belt for an X-ray security scan.]\nPeter: No, Ned, listen! No, no, Ned, the glowy thing is dangerous.\nNed: You missed the Decathlon. I covered for you.\nPeter: Ned, listen to me!\nNed: We\u2019re at the Washington Monument now. You gotta-\n[Liz takes the phone from Ned.]\nLiz: Peter, is that you?\nPeter: Oh, hey, Liz.\nKaren: Is that Liz?\n[Peter jumps from the bus, tumbles on his back, and starts running.]\nPeter: Please put Ned back on the phone.\nKaren: You should tell her how you feel.\n[Peter tries to put a word in edgewise but Liz ignores him and talks on.]\nLiz: You freak! You are so lucky we won. You know, I want to be mad, but I\u2019m more worried. Like, what is going on with you?\n[Now at the Lincoln Memorial, Peter is running towards the Washington Monument.]\nPeter: Liz, I have to talk to Ned. It\u2019s really important!\nSecurity: Miss, all items on the belt, please.\nPeter: Liz, there\u2019s something in Ned\u2019s backpack! It\u2019s really dangerous. Don\u2019t let it go through an X-ray.\n[Not hanging up, Liz puts Ned\u2019s phone through the X-ray machine along with Ned\u2019s backpack. Ned walks through the scanner, oblivious, and moves to collect his backpack. The X-ray scanner screen buzzes.]\nPeter: Liz? Liz! Damn it.\n[Peter keeps running, and the Washington Monument comes into view as he gets closer.]\n[Ned puts on his bag. The students enter an elevator.]\nFlash: Hey, Mr. Harrington, can I be the one to tell Peter he\u2019s expelled?\n[Outside the Washington Monument, Peter webs his backpack to a tree.]\n[The elevator is steadily climbing upwards. The core in Ned\u2019s backpack begins to glow.]\nTour Guide: The Washington Monument is 555 feet, 5 and 1/8 inches tall. Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone.\n[The energy core erupts with light, breaking glass, and the tip of the monument cracks.]\n[Peter arrives at the base of the monument.]\nTourist: Did you hear that?\nPeter: No, no, no, no, no, no. Karen, what\u2019s going on up there?\nKaren: The Chitauri core has detonated and caused severe structural damage to the elevator.\n[The spider suit provides Peter a view inside the monument, and it is shown that several people are gathered inside the elevator.]\nPeter: Oh, no.\nMichelle: My friends are up there!\nPeter: What? Uh... Don\u2019t worry, ma\u2019am. Everything\u2019s gonna be okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my god, that\u2019s tall.\n[Peter runs through the crowd, leaps onto the side of the monument, and crawls up.]\n[On the elevator, Ned drops his backpack. The small space is filled with smoke.]\nCharles: Oh, my god. Look at the ceiling.\n[A glowing, red crack cuts across the elevator ceiling.]\nLiz: Just stay calm, everyone.\nAbe: Oh, we are all going to die here.\n[Michelle peers up at Peter. He\u2019s climbing on the monument, and has gotten so high that he\u2019s merely a dot seen from below.]\nKaren: Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure.\n[Inside the elevator:]\nCharles: We're freakin' screwed.\nTour Guide: Okay guys, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working.\n[Peter is now panting.]\nKaren: The safety systems are completely failing.\n[The tour guide drones on in order to calm the students.]\nTour Guide: We're very safe in here.\n[Outside the Monument:]\nKaren: The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.\nPeter: I'm going as fast as I can!\n[Peter pulls himself up with double strands of web.]\n[Park rangers open the doors to the elevator shaft. The tour guide opens a hatch in the ceiling of the car, and looks out.]\n[Peter continues climbing.]\n[Cindy is pulled out of the elevator.]\nPark Ranger: Let's go. Give me your hand.\nKaren: You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.\n[Peter\u2019s hands slip a little.]\nPeter: What? Why?\nKaren: Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.\n[The spider suit shows the elevator. The park rangers rescuing the students are making the elevator move.\nPETER\nPeter: How do I get in there?\nKAREN\nKaren: Activating reconnaissance drone.\nThe emblem on Peter\u2019s suit detaches, and the spider-shaped robot flies up, over the monument.]\nPeter: Whoa, has that been there the whole time? That\u2019s awesome.\nKaren: Locating optimal entry point.\n[The small drone finds a window.]\nKaren: Proceed to southwest window.\nPeter: Karen, I'm on my way.\n[Peter moves around the monument, and continues climbing. Down below, people have started to gather to see what\u2019s happening.]\n[Inside, Abe peers down the long elevator shaft.]\n[Peter reaches the top of the monument. Pausing, he turns onto his back and clings to the cracked stone.]\nPeter: Ah!\n[Cautiously, Peter peers over the edge to the ground far below.]\nPeter: Okay. Oh, my god. Okay.\n[He then takes panicky breaths and sticks to the wall.]\nKaren: What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window. Why are you hesitating?\nPeter: It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just, I've just never been this high before.\n[Peter tries to shoo away the seagulls perched on the windowsill. Karen\u2019s voice is calm and kind as she informs Peter.]\nKaren: You have also not reinstalled your parachute, so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.\n[Peter moves on top of the windowsill and the seagulls fly away.]\nPeter: Perfect. Oh, my god.\n[Peter kicks the window.]\nPeter: Why is it not breaking?\nKaren: It's a four-inch ballistic glass. You'll have to create more momentum.\n[Peter shoots a web against the monument wall and rappels down the strand until his feet lie flat against the glass. Jumping, he swings against the window. The glass cracks slightly.]\n[Police helicopters approach, guns ready. Speakers boom as a police officer speaks out.]\nPolice: This is D.C. Metro police. Identify yourself.\nPeter: My friends are in there! My friends are in there! Stop!\nPolice: Return to the ground immediately.\n[Inside the elevator:]\nMr. Harrington: Okay, who's next?\n[Liz grabs Mr. Harrington\u2019s shoulder, preparing to climb up.]\nFlash: Me, it's my turn!\n[Flash shoves Liz to get out first, and doesn\u2019t give up the trophy.]\nNed: Flash, seriously? What are you doing?\nFlash: Come on.\nCindy: Don't worry about the trophy.\n[Flash climbs through the hatch in the ceiling of the elevator, and the car shakes.]\nStudents: Ah!\n[Through the yet unbroken window, Peter is watching the students panic.]\n[Peter stands against the window as police helicopters hover around him. An officer is aiming his gun in Peter\u2019s direction.]\nPolice: Stand down! Return to the ground immediately!\n[Peter is panting heavily, but he climbs to the top of the monument.]\nPolice: Return to the ground or we will open fire!\n[The police officer follows Peter with the aim of his gun, but Peter disappears from his view to the other side of the monument.]\nPolice: (to the pilot) Go up, go up!\nPeter: I got this.\nFlash: Take my trophy!\n[The car shakes again under Flash\u2019s feet.]\nPolice: This is your last chance!\nPeter: Oh, I'm gonna die.\n[Peter jumps toward the closest helicopter and extends his web-wings, gliding over the menacing helicopter blades. He shoots a web at the skid, and swings toward the window.]\nPeter: Break!\n[The window shatters into pieces as Peter swings in, and the roof of the elevator is ripped off. The elevator starts to fall. Peter slides in toward the elevator shaft.]\nLiz/Ned: Ahh!\n[Peter shoots a strand of web onto the falling elevator, then braces his feet against the doors to the shaft. Liz, Ned and Mr. Harrington are jostled in the elevator as it is stopped.]\nPeter: I did it! Whoa!\n[The doors break loose, and Peter falls after the plummeting elevator. It catches on a beam and Peter falls in through the ceiling on his back. The impact breaks off a wheel and the car starts to drop again. Peter shoots a web through the hole in the ceiling, stopping the elevator\u2019s descent. Hanging upside down with his feet braced against the ceiling of the elevator, Peter grabs on to the strand of web, and tries to make his voice sound different as he helps his friends calm down.]\nPeter: Ahem. Hey, how you doing? Don't worry about it. I got you.\nNed: Yes! Yes!\n[Ned swings his fist in joy and relief, making the whole elevator wobble.]\nPeter: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, big guy, quit moving around.\nNed: Sorry, sir. So sorry.\n[Outside, a fire truck and an ambulance arrive.]\nPark Ranger: Let's go, let's go!\n[With his web attached to the ceiling high above, Peter slowly pulls the elevator up the shaft. They reach an upper floor.]\nPark Ranger: Okay, okay.\nCindy: Mr. Harrington, go. Ned, come on.\nPeter: Alright. This is your stop.\nNed: Come on, Liz.\n[The metal elevator ceiling starts to bend under Peter\u2019s feet.]\nPeter: Go, go, go. Everybody out! Move it, people. Move it, move it!\nLiz: Are you sure it\u2019s safe?\n[Liz reaches out, but before she can hold Mr. Harrington\u2019s outstretched hand, the ceiling snaps.]\nMr. Harrington: Liz!\n[Peter webs Liz as the elevator falls. She dangles by her wrist.]\nPeter: You\u2019re okay. You\u2019re okay.\n[Peter pulls her up by the web, then takes her hand.]\nPeter: Okay.\n[His web starts to snap as he helps Liz to safety.]\nStudents: Oh, my god. Good, good.\nMr. Harrington: Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back. Come on in. Come on in.\nPeter: So, uh, is everyone okay?\n[Liz nods.]\nKaren: This is your chance, Peter. Kiss her.\n[Liz and Peter hold a look. The web snaps, and Peter drops. The students, the teacher, and the park rangers look down the elevator shaft going after Peter as he falls.]\nMr. Harrington: Thank you.\n[Flash peers down the shaft.]\nFlash: Are you really friends with Peter Parker?\n[In Vulture\u2019s warehouse, Schultz tries out the shocker gauntlet. He can move a whole van with the force of his punch. Mason sits at his work table, clutching his work when the table wobbles.]\nMason: I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck...\nToomes: Ugh, damn it. We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?\nMason: Yeah, but then that's it.\n[Perching on the table, Vulture strokes his chin.]\nMason: Oh, maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.\nToomes: Would you shut up about that?\nMason: It's only one job.\nToomes: No.\n[Schultz stands nearby.]\nToomes: Eight years, not a word from the Feds, nothing from those Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark tower. And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built. Really?\n[Vulture shrugs.]\nToomes: I\u2019m gonna kill him. I'm gonna find him...\nSchultz: I found him.\n[On TV, the news shows spider man at the Washington Monument. The headline says \u201cMan Spider Climbs Washington Monument.\u201d]\nNews Anchor: Spider-Man swooped in, heroically saving an Academic Decathlon team from Queens. The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.\n[Vulture\u2019s expression is unreadable as he studies the screen.]\n[At night, the students\u2019 families meet them by the school bus. Liz\u2019s mother hugs Liz.]\nLiz: Mom.\nDoris: It\u2019s okay. Alright.\nMay: Peter?\n[Aunt May runs to Peter and embraces him.]\nFamilies: Come here, come here. Oh, my god.\n[At school, the student news plays on a TV in the hall.]\nJason: This past weekend, Midtown's Academic Decathlon team defeated the country's best to win the national championship. Later that day, they also defeated death.\nAbe: (yells) Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. Everybody screamin\u2019.\nCharles: (excited) There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere, It was...\n[A cat emoji appears over Charles\u2019 mouth and a beep is inserted as he swears.]\nCharles: ...just like a bon Jovi concert.\nMr. Harrington: As you know, we made it out alive, and that's the important thing. I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip. Not again.\n[The camera amateurishly zooms in on Mr. Harrington\u2019s face.]\nJason: Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, thanks to the Spider-Man.\nJason/Betty: (awkwardly) Thank you, Spider-Man.\nJason: Up next: The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school. How can you show your spider spirit?\n[Peter grins as he walks past the TV showing the student news. A few students are standing around the TV to watch the news. As Peter cheerfully enters another hall, Ned joins him.]\nNed: Dude, dude, dude, dude. What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?\nPeter: Crazy, dude.\nNed: It\u2019s crazy. Should we tell everyone?\nPeter: No.\nNed: Should I tell everyone?\nPeter: No, dude, no, that\u2019s not a good idea.\nNed: Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.\nPeter: I\u2019m not going to class.\nNed: You\u2019re already in so much trouble for ditching the Decathlon.\nPeter: Dude, listen, I figured it out, right? The wing suit guy is stealing from Damage Control. And what he takes from Damage Control, that\u2019s how he builds the weapons. So all I gotta do is catch him.\nNed: But we have a Spanish quiz.\nPeter: Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here. Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate, so when I bring this guy in-\nNed: Dude, you want to be a high school dropout?\nPeter: I am so far beyond high school right now.\nPrincipal Morita: Parker, my office.\n[At detention. A video plays, featuring Captain America. He pulls up a chair and sits.]\nSteve: So... You got detention. You screwed up.\n[Peter sighs and bites his lip in frustration.]\nSteve: You know what you did was wrong. The question is, how are you gonna make things right? Maybe you were trying to be cool. But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years, the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.\n[We see the classroom is sparsely filled with students. Michelle is sitting in a seat behind Peter. Peter sighs again and stands up forcefully.]\nSteve: We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong. Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something you know is wrong...\n[Peter gets up and marches out past Michelle. Coach Wilson is slouching at a desk.]\nCoach Wilson: (indifferently) Hey, where you going? Get back here.\nSteve: Just think to yourself, what would Captain America do?\nCoach Wilson: (to Michelle) Why are you here? You don't even have detention.\nMichelle: Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis.\n[Michelle holds up a sketch depicting Coach Wilson.]\nMichelle: Heh. It's you.\nSteve: So your body's changing. Believe me, I know how that feels.\n[In the empty hallway, Peter lifts a row of lockers off the ground, revealing a hidden space beneath. He grabs a bottle of web fluid and lowers the lockers. Peter throws the bottle up in the air, and catches it again.]\n[Arriving home, Peter peeks in the front door.]\nPeter: May?\n[He checks the living room, which looks empty.]\n[We are now inside Peter's bedroom. Peter is wearing normal clothes over his suit and lounging in his chair.]\nPeter: Hey, Karen. What's up?\nKaren: Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?\nPeter: Listen, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night, but I mean, I can only kind of remember part of a license plate.\nKaren: I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.\n[A string of data appears in front of Peter\u2019s eyes.]\nPeter: Footage?\nKaren: Yes, Peter. I record everything you see.\nPeter: Everything?\nKaren: Everything.\nPeter: Like all the time?\nKaren: It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.\n[Peter throws away his pen in irritation.]\nPeter: Yeah, of course it is. Um, yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.\nKaren: With pleasure.\n[Karen shows a footage of Peter fooling around in front of a mirror in his spider suit mask.]\nPeter: (on video)Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party. Hey, what's up, Liz? Peter's told me a lot about you.\n[The Peter in the footage winks.]\nPeter: No, no, no. No, no, no. This is just me messing around. Go later in the day, later in the day.\n[Karen fast-forwards the video.]\nPeter: (on video) It is I, Thor, son of Odin!\n[Peter is doing impressions of Thor, holding a wooden hammer in his hand.]\nPeter: No, no, no, no, no, no. That's definitely... no. That's definitely not what we wanted to watch. Just...\nKaren: Your impressions are very funny.\nPeter: Fast-forward to the arms deal.\n[Peter stands up. The footage shows three men from the arms deal that Peter was searching for.]\nPeter: Okay. The two on the right, who are they?\nKaren: Searching law enforcement databases. No records found for two of the individuals.\nPeter: Nothing?\nKaren: One individual identified. Aaron Davis, age 33. He has a criminal record and an address here in Queens.\n[The spider suit displays the criminal record of Aaron Davis.]\nPeter: Let's pay him a visit.\nKaren: Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?\nPeter: Uh, yeah.\n[In a parking building, the scruffy man from the weapons deal, Aaron Davis, carries groceries to his car. The spider drone follows him. As Aaron opens the trunk, Peter arrives in his spider man suit. He sticks Aaron\u2019s hand to the trunk with a web. Annoyed, Aaron stares at the spider drone.]\nPeter: Remember me?\n[Peter speaks in a deep metallic voice. He approaches Aaron\u2019s car, and Aaron seems taken aback.]\nAaron: Uh, hey...\nPeter: I need information. You're gonna give it to me now.\nAaron: All right, chill.\nPeter: Come on!\nAaron: What happened to your voice?\nPeter: What do you mean, what happened to my voice?\nAaron: I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like.\nPeter: I'm not a girl! I'm a boy. I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.\nAaron: I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...\nPeter: I'm not a girl! I'm a man. Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons? I need to know. Give me names or else.\n[Aaron slams the trunk shut, and Peter startles. He steps back and looks around in surprise. The spider drone chirps and flies around Peter\u2019s head.]\nAaron: You ain't ever done this before, huh?\nPeter: Deactivate interrogation mode.\n[The spider drone goes back in the emblem on the suit\u2019s chest. Aaron laughs. Peter\u2019s voice changes back to its high-pitched tone.]\nPeter: Look, man, these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous. They can't just be out on the streets. Look, if one of them can just cut Delmar's bodega in half...\n[Aaron is looking at his fingers, sniffing, not amused. However, when Peter mentions Delmar\u2019s, he gains interest.]\nAaron: You know Delmar's?\nPeter: Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.\nAaron: Sub Haven's pretty good.\nPeter: It's too much bread.\nAaron: I like bread.\nPeter: Come on, man, please.\n[Peter starts to walk away.]\nPeter: Stupid interrogation mode. Karen, don't ever do that again.\nAaron: The other night, you told that dude, \"if you shoot somebody, shoot me.\" It's pretty ballsy. I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood. I got a nephew who live here.\n[Peter stops when Aaron starts speaking, and walks back to him.]\nPeter: Who are these guys? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?\nAaron: Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing. I don't know who he is or where he is.\n[Peter leans his head on Aaron\u2019s car, and gives out a sigh.]\nAaron: I do know where he's gonna be.\nPeter: Really?\nAaron: Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with, he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.\nPeter: Yes! Yes. Thank-\n[Peter starts to walk happily away, giggling.]\nAaron: Hey. Hey. Hey. I didn't tell you where. You don't have a location.\nPeter: Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...\n[Embarrassed, Peter comes closer and leans on the car.]\nPeter: Yeah. Where is it?\nAaron: Can I give you some advice?\nPeter: Hmm?\nAaron: You got to get better at this part of the job.\nPeter: I don't understand. I'm intimidating.\n[Peter demonstrates his \u201cintimidating\u201d pose, crossing his arms.]\nAaron: Staten Island ferry, eleven.\nPeter: Oh, that's soon. Hey, that's gonna dissolve in two hours.\nAaron: No, no, no, no. Come fix this.\nPeter: Two hours. You deserve that.\n[Peter walks away, stabbing a finger in Aaron\u2019s direction.]\nAaron: I got ice cream in here.\nPeter: You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal.\n[At the Staten Island Ferry terminal, Peter swings onto a building roof. As the massive orange ferry pulls out of the dock, he takes a running leap and spreads his glider wings. He lands and hangs on the hull.]\nPeter: (grunts) Nice.\n[He peeks through a window and sees passengers sitting inside.]\nPeter: Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.\nKaren: Sure thing.\nToomes: He\u2019s up front. Main deck.\nSchultz: I hate this guy.\nPeter: It\u2019s the guy from the bridge, right? Who\u2019s that other guy?\nToomes: Just keep me posted.\nKaren: There\u2019s no record of him in my criminal database. Incoming call from May Peter. Should I reroute to your heads-up display?\nPeter: I can\u2019t talk right now. I\u2019ll call her back.\n[He watches Toomes. The spider drone climbs onto his head.]\nPeter: Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can\u2019t let anybody get away this time.\n[The drone hovers by the window. Peter climbs up to the ferry roof. He crawls to the edge and peers down at four men on the front deck.]\nPeter: Who\u2019s the guy on the left?\nKaren: Mac Gargan. Extensive criminal record, including homicide. Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?\nPeter: No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already.\n[Schultz approaches Gargan.]\nSchultz: White pickup truck.\n[Gargan nods to a slim man who walks away.]\nPeter: Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck.\n[The tiny drone scans the cargo under the deck and spots a pickup truck. It hovers over the truck and scans its contents. Toomes\u2019 coworker gets out of the car and leads the slim man to the back.]\nPeter: Oh, this is too perfect. I got the weapons, buyers, and sellers all in one place.\nKaren: Incoming call from Tony Stark.\nPeter: No, no, no. No, no, don\u2019t answer.\nTony: Mr. Parker. Got a sec?\nPeter: Uh, I\u2019m actually at school.\nKaren: No, you\u2019re not.\nTony: Nice work in D.C.\nPeter: Okay.\nTony: My dad never really gave me a lot of support... And I\u2019m just trying to break the cycle of shame.\nPeter: Uh, I\u2019m kind of in the middle of something right now.\nTony: Don\u2019t cut me off when I\u2019m complimenting you. Anyway, great things are about to-\n[The ferry horn blares.]\nTony: What is that?\nPeter: Uh, I\u2019m at band practice.\nTony: That\u2019s odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What\u2019s up?\nPeter: I gotta go. Uh, end call.\nTony: Hey.\nPeter: I\u2019ll take those! (snatches a key chain) Yoink!\n[He then leaps onto the deck.]\nPeter: Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal-ferry was at 10:30. You missed it.\n[He disarms two guys with the spiderweb, kicks Gargan, and slams him. Peter ducks from Schultz\u2019s Shocker gauntlet, which gets caught in a gate.]\nRandy: Spider guy\u2019s here.\n[Toomes leaves his seat. Two thugs get up behind Peter.]\nPeter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.\n[Peter throws them both.]\nPeter: Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard.\n[He eyes Schultz, who is still struggling to free himself.]\nPeter: I gotta say the other guy was way better with that thing.\n[He then reloads his web-shooter.]\nPeter: I\u2019m honestly, I\u2019m, I\u2019m shocked.\n[Peter shoots a web grenade behind him, attaching a thug to the wall with it. In the cargo hold, Toomes bashes the slim man\u2019s head against the truck. He then faces Peter, who is standing yards away on deck. Suddenly, agents come out of nowhere and aim at Peter.]\nFBI Agent 1: Freeze! FBI!\nFBI Agent 2: Don\u2019t move.\nFBI Agent 1: Get on the ground.\nFBI Agent 1: FBI.\nPeter: Wait, what do you mean, FBI?\nKaren: The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nPeter: I know what the FBI means, but what are they doing here?\n[A mechanical wing bursts out of the truck, making the agents turn to it. Toomes flies toward the deck in his vulture suit. Agents shoot at him.]\nPeter: Get out of the way! Get out of the way!\n[Vulture fires a high tech weapon, drags a car, and throws it to the agents.]\nPeter: Look out, look out, look out. Move, move, move!\n[Vulture hits Peter, causing him to fall into the water. He then fires energy blasts at a man\u2019s arm.]\nToomes: Get to the top deck. We\u2019re getting out of here.\n[Peter shoots his web at Schultz, but misses. He shoots the web at Vulture\u2019s leg and pulls. Vulture hides behind his large metal wings that protects him from the gunfire, then shoots at the agents. One blast hits an indoor seating area. Peter weighs Vulture with a car attached to his web. Dodging a blast, he leaps to the upper deck and shoots some more web. Hanging from Vulture\u2019s suit, Peter swings over the water. The flying man fires at Peter. He swings back onto the deck. Vulture cuts the strands of web with the blades of his wings. Peter shoots web at the barrel of Vulture\u2019s high tech weapon.]\nPeter: Activate Taser Web!\n[Electricity travels up the strand of web and the weapon is yanked away from Vulture. On the deck, it bounces around wildly. Peter traps the weapon using lots of spiderweb.]\nToomes: You\u2019re messing with things you don\u2019t understand.\n[The weapon\u2019s laser beam breaks up into multiple rays. The energy blast cuts through the upper seating area, narrowly missing frightened passengers. In the air, Vulture dodges the blasts as they shoot into the sky. Schultz sprints toward an upper deck, leaps into the air, and lands on Vulture\u2019s back. The rays slice through the length of the ferry, then vanish. In the seating area, passengers move cautiously. In the cargo bay, jets of water start to split up the ferry.]\nPeter: Oh, my god. What do I do? Karen, uh, give me an X-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points.\n[Peter\u2019s display highlights spots on the structure.]\nPeter: Web grenade. Web grenade.\n[Shooting web, he leaps between the two sides of the ship.]\nPeter: Splitter web, go.\n[Peter tumbles back and forth on the upper part of the ferry, connecting the ship with strands of web. He dodges flames as he travels down the length of the ferry. Peter fires several strands of web and once, and binds them together with another strand. Reaching the bow, he crouches on the edge of the roof. He eyes the two leaning halves of the ferry that are crisscrossed with spiderweb.]\nKaren: Great job, Peter. You are 98 percent successful.\nPeter: Ninety-eight?\nMan: Yeah, Spider-Man!\n[The web strands begin to snap.]\nPeter: No, no, no, no!\n[Water floods the cargo hold, pushing the cars forward. People cling to posts as the stream rushes past them. On the upper level, passengers slide down the floor of the leaning ferry. The gap widens as the web strands continue to snap. Peter leaps into the air.]\nPeter: No!\n[He grabs a thread and shoots another. Arms outstretched, Peter hangs between the two sides, trying to hold them together.]\n[Suddenly, the two sides start to move toward each other.]\nPeter: What the hell?\n[Peter lands gently in the seating area and looks around.]\nPeter: What the hell...\n[Iron Man rises into view.]\nTony: Hi, Spider-Man. Band practice, was it?\n[Hovering outside, he holds up one half of the boat. Drones arrive and attach themselves to the other half. Thrusters propel the two halves of the ferry forward and join them together.]\n[Iron Man looks at Peter through the window, then flies off.]\nMan: Yeah, Iron Man!\n[Peter swings into the cargo hold, where Iron Man is welding the ferry back together.]\nPeter: Uh, Mr. Stark? Hey, Mr. Stark. Could I do anything? What do you want me to do?\nTony: I think you\u2019ve done enough.\n[Iron Man flies away. Peter climbs to the top platform of a mast and looks around. Smoke is pouring out from the massive vessel. Rescue boats and helicopters approach from all directions.]\n[Schultz is walking toward Vulture in the warehouse when he speaks out:]\nToomes: So that\u2019s it, you\u2019re just gonna run?\nSchultz: Feds were waiting for us. Now we\u2019re on Iron Man\u2019s radar? Yeah, I\u2019m running. You should, too.\nToomes: You know I can\u2019t do that.\nSchultz: So now what?\nToomes: Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time?\nMason: Seriously? Yes. You will not regret this.\nToomes: (to Schultz) You in?\n[Schultz smiles faintly and lifts his eyebrows.]\n[Helicopters are still flying around the ferry. Peter is perching on the edge of a building, sans mask, when Iron Man flies over to him.]\nTony: Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch: I tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing I told you not to do.\nPeter: Is everyone okay?\nTony: No thanks to you.\nPeter: No thanks to me?\n[Angered, Peter jumps off the edge and approaches Tony.]\nPeter: Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it. But you didn\u2019t listen. None of this would\u2019ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you\u2019d actually be here.\n[The Iron Man suit opens, revealing Tony inside. He steps down from the suit and marches toward Peter, who backs off.]\nTony: I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid.\nPeter: I\u2019m fifteen.\nTony: No, this is where you zip it, all right? The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? \u2018Cause that\u2019s on you. And if you died, I feel like that\u2019s on me. I don\u2019t need that on my conscience.\nPeter: Yes, sir.\nTony: Yes.\nPeter: I, I\u2019m sorry.\nTony: Sorry doesn\u2019t cut it.\nPeter: I understand. I just wanted to be like you.\nTony: And I wanted you to be better. Okay, it\u2019s not working out. I\u2019m gonna need the suit back.\nPeter: For how long?\nTony: Forever.\n[Peter shakes his head with a shocked expression.]\nTony: Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s how it works.\nPeter: No, no, no... Please, please, please...\nTony: Let\u2019s have it.\nPeter: You don\u2019t understand. Please. This is all I have. I\u2019m nothing without this suit.\nTony: If you\u2019re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\u2019t have it. Okay? God, I sound like my dad.\nPeter: I don\u2019t have any other clothes.\nTony: Okay, we\u2019ll sort that out.\n[Peter walks down the hallway of his apartment wearing pink Hello Kitty pajamas and an oversized NYC tourist T-shirt. He knocks on a door, which May answers.]\nPeter: (whispers) Hey.\n[May inhales deeply and storms inside.]\nMay: I\u2019ve been calling you all day. You didn\u2019t answer your phone. You can\u2019t do that. Then this ferry thing happens. I\u2019ve called five police stations.\n[Peter walks to May and stands behind her.]\nMay: Five. I called five of your friends.\nPeter: I\u2019m fine.\nMay: I called Ned\u2019s mother.\nPeter: May, I\u2019m okay. Honestly. Just relax. I\u2019m fine.\n[May stands and faces Peter.]\nMay: You. Cut the bullshit. I know you left detention. I know you left the hotel room in Washington. I know you sneak out of this house every night. That\u2019s not fine. Peter, you have to tell me what\u2019s going on. Just lay it out. It\u2019s just me and you.\n[A beat, then Peter\u2019s eyes fill up with tears.]\nPeter: I lost the Stark internship.\nMay: What?\nPeter: Yeah.\nMay: What happened?\nPeter: I just thought that I could work really hard and he could, he would, you know. But I screwed it up.\n[Peter sits down on the sofa next to him. May hugs him and strokes him.]\nMay: Oh... It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\nPeter: I\u2019m sorry I made you worry.\nMay: You know I\u2019m not trying to ruin your life.\nPeter: Yeah, I know.\nMay: Just... I used to sneak out too.\nPeter: Yeah.\n[May scowls, then leans in to sniff Peter\u2019s hair.]\nMay: And take a shower. You smell. You smell like garbage.\nPeter: I know.\n[Through a window, we see Peter facing Principal Morita.]\nPrincipal Morita: Peter, you\u2019re a good kid and you\u2019re a smart kid. So just try to keep your head straight, okay?\nPeter: Okay.\nPrincipal Morita: All right. Get out of here.\n[Peter takes his bag, exits the principal\u2019s office. Ned is waiting for him in the hallway.]\nNed: Are you expelled? Do you have to go to that high school on 46th where the principal has a crossbow?\nPeter: Pretty sure that\u2019s an urban myth, and no, I\u2019m not expelled.\nNed: You\u2019re so lucky.\n[They walk down the corridor. Tilt up to find a homecoming banner hanging from the ceiling.]\n[Peter is resting his head on the desk at detention. He turns to find Michelle holding up a sketch of him with a sad expression.]\n[We are now in Spanish class. The clock is ticking. A hand holding a blue pen shoots into frame. It\u2019s Peter.]\nPeter: Me gusta hacer la tarea. (I like doing homework.)\nSpanish Teacher: Muy bueno, se\u00f1or Parker. (Very good, Mr. Parker.)\n[Peter and Ned finish building the Lego Death Star in the orchestra practice room. Ned hands Peter the Palpatine figure, which Peter places on the top. They do a secret handshake.]\n[School bell rings. Peter walks out into an empty hallway and sees Liz.]\nPeter: Hey.\nLiz: Hey.\nPeter: I thought you had calculus fifth period.\nLiz: Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.\n[Peter approaches Liz.]\nPeter: Hey, look, I, uh... I just wanted to apologize about the whole Decathlon thing. I really-\nLiz: It\u2019s fine. Last week, Decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died.\nPeter: No, I, I just mean that... it was not cool, especially... (sighs) ...because... I like you.\nLiz: I know.\n[Peter stares at her, shocked.]\nPeter: You do?\nLiz: You\u2019re terrible at keeping secrets.\nPeter: (smiles) Yeah, you\u2019d be surprised.\n[An awkward moment. They look at each other.]\nPeter: I got to get to class, but, um, I\u2019d say we should hang out, but I\u2019m gonna be in detention for...\nLiz: Uh-huh.\nPeter: ...ever, but, um, I guess you already have a date to homecoming.\nLiz: Actually, I was so busy planning it I never really got around to that part, so...\n[Liz shakes her head.]\nPeter: Uh, do you want to go with me?\nLiz: (smiles) Yeah. Sure.\nPeter: Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool.\nLiz: Cool.\nPeter: I\u2019m actually going that way.\n[Carrying the hall pass, Peter walks past Liz. We see her turning to watch him go in the background. A huge grin breaks across Peter\u2019s face.]\n[In his apartment, Peter slides into the kitchen with a frenzied look.]\nPeter: May, I need your help.\n[May stares at him with a surprised expression. Peter picks out a dress shirt and tie, polishes his shoes, shakes his head in front of a mirror. May prepares a pink ribbon corsage for him. Peter sprays a perfume in the air to test it, then grimaces at the scent. May and Peter watch a YouTube video on how to tie a Windsor knot. Peter turns to May with a surprisingly passable Windsor knot; overlooking his lopsided shirt collar, that is.]\nMay: Right?\n[Peter is now fully dressed in a suit. May teaches him how to dance, then straightens his clothes.]\n[May\u2019s car comes to a stop in front of Liz\u2019s house.]\nMay: It\u2019s game day. So, what\u2019s the plan?\nPeter: Open the door for her.\nMay: Mm-hmm.\nPeter: Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that\u2019s creepy.\nMay: Don\u2019t be creepy.\nPeter: No. And, uh, when I dance with her, I\u2019m putting my hands on her hips. I got this.\n[Peter gets out of the car and leans into the car window.]\nPeter: Love you.\nMay: Bye.\n[Peter walks up to the front door, pink corsage in hand, then rings the doorbell. He waits with a nervous look for the door to open. With Toomes on the other side. Peter\u2019s smile fades and he freezes. Toomes grins at him.]\nToomes: You must be Peter.\nPeter: Yeah.\nToomes: I\u2019m Liz\u2019s dad. Put her there.\n[They shake hands.]\nToomes: Hell of a grip. Come on in here. Come on.\n[Toomes drags Peter inside and closes the door. Peter follows Toomes towards the kitchen. Suddenly:]\nDoris: Hi, Peter. You look very handsome.\nPeter: Thank you.\nDoris: (whispers) You got his name right?\nToomes: Freddie?\nDoris: Peter.\nToomes: Peter, Peter.\n[Doris chuckles and shakes her head.]\nDoris: I\u2019m gonna go get Liz.\nPeter: Okay.\n[She walks out, leaving Peter with Toomes. Toomes starts to polish knives.]\nToomes: You all right, Pete?\nPeter: Yeah.\nToomes: Because you look pale. You want something to drink? Like a bourbon or a scotch, or something like that?\nPeter: I\u2019m not old enough to drink.\nToomes: That\u2019s the right answer.\n[Toomes\u2019 eyes widen as he sees his daughter dressed in a beautiful red dress.]\nToomes: Wow.\n[Peter turns in order to see Liz.]\nToomes: Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful.\nLiz: Please don\u2019t embarrass me, Dad.\nToomes: Doesn\u2019t she, Pete?\n[Liz moves to stand next to Peter.]\nPeter: Yeah, you look really good.\nToomes: Once again, that\u2019s the right answer.\nLiz: Is that a corsage?\n[Staring at Toomes, Peter abruptly hands the corsage to Liz.]\nLiz: Thanks.\nToomes: Well, hey, I\u2019m your chauffeur, so, uh, let\u2019s get this show on the road.\nDoris: No, no, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right. Oh, right here. Perfect.\nLiz: Mom.\nDoris: Okay. Come on, you guys. Peter, closer.\n[Peter stands beside Liz.]\nDoris: Smile. There you go.\n[Liz\u2019s mother takes some more snaps. Peter puts on a tense grin for the photo, his eyes still glued on Toomes.]\nPeter: Sir, you don\u2019t have to drive us.\nToomes: No, no, it\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m going out of town. It\u2019s right on my way.\n[Liz goes to her mother to check the photos.]\nDoris: He\u2019s always coming and going.\nToomes: Last time.\nDoris: Have fun.\n[Doris hugs her daughter.]\nLiz: Thank you.\nToomes: Promise.\nDoris: (whispers) He\u2019s cute.\nLiz: Shh.\nToomes: See you in a couple of days.\nDoris: Bye, baby.\nToomes: All right.\n[Doris and Adrian Toomes kiss each other.]\nToomes: Come on, Pedro.\nDoris: Bye, Peter. Have fun.\nPeter: Yeah, I will.\n[Toomes is driving. Liz looks at herself through her phone camera, wearing the corsage Peter gave her, while Peter stares out the window.]\nToomes: What are you gonna do, Pete?\nPeter: What?\nToomes: When you graduate, what do you think you\u2019re gonna do?\nPeter: Oh, um, I don\u2019t know.\nLiz: Don\u2019t grill him, Dad.\nToomes: Just saying, you know. All you guys who go to that school, you pretty much have your life planned out, right?\nPeter: Yeah, no, I\u2019m just a sophomore.\nLiz: Peter has an internship with Tony Stark. So I think he doesn\u2019t have to worry.\nToomes: Really?\nLiz: Mm-hmm.\nToomes: Stark?\nLiz: So cool.\nToomes: What do you do?\nPeter: Yeah, actually, I don\u2019t intern for him anymore.\n[Liz turns to Peter, frowning.]\nLiz: Seriously?\nPeter: Yeah, it got, um... boring.\nLiz: It was boring? You got to hang out with Spider-Man.\nToomes: Really? Spider-Man? Wow. What\u2019s he like?\nPeter: Yeah, he\u2019s nice. Nice man. Solid dude.\nToomes: Hmm.\n[Liz shows Peter her phone.]\nLiz: Look, so cute.\nPeter: Aww...\n[Toomes keeps stealing glances at Peter.]\nToomes: I\u2019ve seen you around, right? I mean... Somewhere. We\u2019ve, uh, have we ever? Because even the voice...\nLiz: Um, he does Academic Decathlon with me.\nToomes: Oh.\nLiz: And he was at my party.\nToomes: Ah.\nPeter: It was a great party, really great, yeah. Beautiful house, a lot of windows.\n[Peter and Liz smile at each other.]\nLiz: You were there for, like, two seconds.\nPeter: That was... I was there longer than two seconds.\nLiz: You disappeared.\nPeter: No, no. I did not disappear.\nLiz: Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do. Like you did in D.C., too.\n[Toomes glances at Peter suspiciously. He stops at an intersection.]\nToomes: That\u2019s terrible, what happened down there in D.C., though. Were you scared?\n[Peter nods tersely.]\nToomes: I\u2019ll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man showed up in the elevator, though, huh?\n[Peter glances at Liz, then:]\nPeter: Yeah, well, I actually didn\u2019t go up. I saw it all from the ground.\nLiz: Yeah.\n[Toomes stares at Peter through the rearview mirror.]\nPeter: Very lucky that he was there that day.\nToomes: (grins) Good old Spider-Man.\n[The traffic light turns green. Car honks blare behind them.]\nLiz: Dad, the light.\n[Toomes continues driving and arrives at Midtown High. Outside, well-dressed teenagers are walking to the entrance decorated with colorful balloons.]\nToomes: Here we are. End of the line.\nLiz: Thanks, Dad.\nToomes: You head in there, gumdrop. I\u2019m gonna give Peter the, uh, the \u201cdad talk.\u201d\nLiz: (to Peter) Don\u2019t let him intimidate you.\n[Liz kisses her dad on the cheek.]\nLiz: Love you.\nToomes: Love you, gumdrop.\nLiz: Have a safe flight.\n[Liz gets out of the car and joins her friends.]\nLiz: Hi! You guys look so pretty.\n[Toomes turns to Peter with a gun.]\nToomes: Does she know?\nPeter: Know what?\nToomes: So she doesn\u2019t. Good. Close to the vest. I admire that. I\u2019ve got a few secrets of my own. Of all the reasons I didn\u2019t want my daughter to date...\n[Toomes cracks a grin and shrugs, but Peter does not say anything.]\nToomes: Peter, nothing is more important than family. You saved my daughter\u2019s life. I could never forget something like that. So I\u2019m gonna give you one chance. Are you ready? You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened. And don\u2019t you ever, ever interfere with my business again. Because if you do, I\u2019ll kill you and everybody you love. I\u2019ll kill you dead. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do to protect my family. Do you understand?\n[Peter nods, unable to meet Toomes\u2019 eyes.]\nToomes: Hey. I just saved your life. Now, what do you say?\n[Peter raises his head and looks straight at Toomes.]\nPeter: Thank you.\nToomes: You\u2019re welcome. Now, you go in there and you show my daughter a good time, okay? Just not too good.\n[Peter gets out of the car with a tense expression on his face. Toomes drives off. Peter enters the school.]\n[Peter walks down the hallway, all sounds muffled as if underwater. He stops and watches his friends through the glass doors. Party in full swing. Spotting him, Ned waves and Michelle gives Peter the finger. A beat, then Peter pulls open the door. Pop music and chattering instantly fills Peter\u2019s ears. Liz is dancing with some of her friends. She turns to Peter when he approaches.]\nLiz: Hey. What did he say to you?\n[Peter just stares at Liz with an anxious look. Liz realizes that something is off.]\nPeter: Gotta go. I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry. You don\u2019t deserve this.\n[Peter hurries away, leaving Liz in the middle of the dance floor. Michelle watches him go, craning her neck.]\n[Peter rushes out through the hallway and unties his tie. He lifts a row of lockers with one hand, picks up his homemade Spider-Man suit from under it.]\n[Now clad in his homemade Spider-Man suit, Peter exits the school. As he is about to round a school bus, someone shocks him from behind.]\nSchultz: He gave you a choice. You chose wrong.\nPeter: Ah, what the hell?\nSchultz: What\u2019s with the crappy costume?\n[The Shocker prepares his gauntlet for another shot. Peter searches for his web-shooter, which has fallen from the impact and is lying on the ground.]\nPeter: My web-shooters...\n[Peter runs to the web-shooter, but Schultz hits a school bus to attack Peter, then kicks the web-shooter away.]\nSchultz: I wasn\u2019t sure about this thing at first, but damn.\n[Schultz hits Peter with the weapon, throwing him inside the bus. Peter spots chewed gums under a seat.]\nPeter: Ugh. Gross.\n[Schultz punches the bus into the air. Peter tumbles as the vehicle lands upside down on the ground. Opening the door, Peter falls out. He slowly crawls to his web-shooter.]\nPeter: Why did he send you here?\nSchultz: Guess you\u2019ll never know.\n[Suddenly, a strand of web attaches itself to the Shocker gauntlet. Reveal Ned holding the web-shooter.]\nPeter: Nice shot!\n[Peter pulls the web-shooter to himself and traps Schultz against the school bus with a web blast.]\nPeter: Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz\u2019s dad.\nNed: What?\nPeter: I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark. Call Happy Hogan. He\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s head of security. And, uh, get a computer to track my phone for me.\nNed: Are you gonna be okay?\n[Peter jumps up onto a streetlight.]\nPeter: Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town.\n[Ned hurries toward the school building as Peter swings away.]\n[Flash is driving his annoyed date to the homecoming dance.]\nFlash: I\u2019m sorry about dinner, but I know when branzino\u2019s fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So...\n[Flash screams as Peter lands on the bonnet of his car.]\nPeter: (in a gravelly voice) Flash, I need your car and your phone.\nFlash: Uh, sir, technically, this is my dad\u2019s car, sir. So I can\u2019t...\n[Flash watches the Spider-Man drive away in his car and hit a row of bikes. He whimpers.]\n[Peter makes a call to Ned while driving precariously. Ned takes it in the library, between rows of computers.]\nPeter: (in a normal voice) Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?\nNed: Go for Ned.\nPeter: Ned, I need you to track my phone for me.\nNed: Yeah, but where is it?\n[Peter's phone lights up in the backseat of Toomes\u2019 car. Toomes is unaware. Ned tracks the signal.]\nNed: Genius move. Okay, he just passed the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.\nPeter: Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I\u2019m in Flash\u2019s car.\n[Ned rolls his chair to another computer.]\nNed: I\u2019ll pull the specs.\nPeter: Okay, you\u2019re on speakerphone.\nNed: You stole Flash\u2019s car. Awesome.\nPeter: Yeah, it\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s awe... Whoa!\n[Peter nearly crashes into other cars.]\nPeter: Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move! Move!\nNed: Peter, are you okay?\nPeter: I\u2019ve never really driven before. Only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up...\n[A car nearly hits Peter, who screams.]\nPeter: Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?\nNed: Yeah. I\u2019m working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system.\n[Ned rapidly types, then twirls in his chair.]\nNed: Guy in the chair.\n[Toomes checks his watch and heads to an old Brooklyn factory warehouse.]\n[Happy pops up on Ned\u2019s computer screen.]\nHappy: Takeoff in nine minutes. (to Ned) Hello? Hello? Who is this?\nNed: Uh... Mr. Happy, it\u2019s Ned.\nHappy: Who?\nNed: I\u2019m an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you-\nHappy: You gotta be shitting me.\n[Happy\u2019s screen goes off.]\nNed: Damn.\nPeter: Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?\nNed: Uh... Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.\nPeter: Left. Okay. Okay, perfect. So where\u2019s my phone now?\nNed: Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.\nPeter: What? That makes no sense. I thought he said he was going out of town!\n[The car is a literal hazard as it drives down the road.]\nNed: Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don\u2019t think he likes you, by the way. It sounded like he was catching a flight. He said something about taking off in nine minutes.\nPeter: What?\nNed: He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.\nPeter: Boxes? It\u2019s moving day. It\u2019s moving day! It\u2019s moving day! He\u2019s gonna rob that plane! I gotta stop him!\n[Inside Avengers Tower, Happy is talking on the phone, checking Tony\u2019s belongings.]\nHappy: All right, wheels up in eight minutes. We just got to load Tony\u2019s old Hulkbuster armor, prototype for Cap\u2019s new shield, and the Meging... the Meg... the... Thor\u2019s magic belt.\n[Peter drives down an empty road at a high speed.]\nNed: Okay, slow down. You\u2019re getting close. It\u2019s on your right.\nPeter: What?\nNed: Turn right! Turn right!\n[Peter shoots his web to make a sharp turn. The car crashes into a streetlight and is almost overturned. It slides down the road on its side, then finally screeches to a stop.]\nNed: Peter, are you okay?\nPeter: Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to Happy.\n[Peter jumps out of the car.]\nNed: It\u2019s been an honor, Spider-Man.\n[Suddenly, the lights come on. Reveal Ms. Warren standing behind Ned.]\nMs. Warren: What are you doing here? There\u2019s a dance.\nNed: Uh...\n[Ned hurriedly closes his laptop.]\nNed: (awkwardly) I\u2019m... looking... at... porn.\n[We see a small window in the ceiling open. Peter hangs from his web and slowly descends into the building. The room is filled with computers and gadgets. Monitors showing Avengers Tower and the blueprint of Stark\u2019s plane. Peter spots Vulture\u2019s wing suit and goes deeper inside.]\nPeter: Hey! Surprised?\nToomes: Oh, hey, Pete. I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\nPeter: It\u2019s over. I\u2019ve got you.\nToomes: You know, I gotta tell you, Pete, I really, really admire your grit. I see why Liz likes you. I do. When you first came to the house, I wasn\u2019t sure. I thought, \u201cReally?\u201d But I get it now.\nPeter: How could you do this to her?\nToomes: To her? I\u2019m not doing anything to her, Pete. I\u2019m doing this for her.\nPeter: Huh, yeah.\n[Peter shoots his web and glues Vulture\u2019s left hand against the desk.]\nToomes: (sighs) Peter, you\u2019re young. You don\u2019t understand how the world works.\nPeter: Yeah, but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.\nToomes: How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower? Or any of his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us, like you and me, they don\u2019t care about us. We build their roads and we fight all their wars and everything, but they don\u2019t care about us. We have to pick up after \u2018em. We have to eat their table scraps. That\u2019s how it is. I know you know what I\u2019m talking about, Peter.\nPeter: Why are you telling me this?\nToomes: Because I want you to understand. And... I needed a little time to get her airborne.\n[Vulture takes a folding knife out of his pocket. Vulture\u2019s wing suit flies out from behind Peter\u2019s back, which he avoids. In the confusion of the moment, Vulture cuts free from the web. The wing suit continues to attack Peter, but he avoids it with quick movements.]\nToomes: I\u2019m sorry, Peter.\nPeter: What are you talking about? That thing hasn\u2019t even touched me yet.\nToomes: True. Then again, wasn\u2019t really trying to.\n[Peter realizes that the wing suit wasn\u2019t attacking him; instead, it was chopping down the pillars. The building collapses, its wreckage raining down on Peter and burying him. Vulture picks up a walkie-talkie.]\nMason: Chief, they\u2019re powering up engines.\nToomes: Okay.\nMason: Come on, come on, come on.\nToomes: Yeah, yeah.\n[Vulture takes one last look of the pile of debris covering Peter, then walks away. He pauses to stare at the Avengers Tower. His wing suit attaches itself on his back.]\n[The plane is about to take off from the Avengers Tower. Happy walks away from it.]\n[We hear grunts and cries. Reveal Peter under the debris, still alive. He panics and takes off his mask.]\nPeter: Oh, god. Okay, ready?\n[He struggles to get up but fails.]\nPeter: Hello! Hello! Please. Hey, hey, please. I\u2019m down here. I\u2019m down here. I\u2019m stuck. I\u2019m stuck. I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t...\n[Peter takes a moment to catch his breath and looks down at his reflection on a puddle. The Spider-Man mask in the puddle covers half the reflection, making it look as if Peter is wearing the Spider-Man mask on half his face.]\nTony: If you\u2019re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\u2019t have it.\n[Once again, Peter tries to push the debris off his back.]\nPeter: Come on, Peter. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man!\n[Peter finally frees himself from the debris and gets up amongst rubbles. He spots Vulture perching on top of a stripped billboard.]\n[The plane takes off from Avengers Tower.]\n[Mason is sitting in a control room.]\nMason: Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light.\nToomes: Oh, yeah.\n[Vulture spreads his wings and prepares for takeoff. Peter shoots his web and swings onto the billboard, but narrowly misses Vulture, who flies away. Spider-Man shoots his web directly at Vulture.]\nTech: Retro-reflective panels engaged.\n[The outer panels of the plane light up and mirror the New York City. Vulture goes after the plane.]\nToomes: Got a visual on the plane, feeling a little resistance.\nMason: It\u2019s probably just a drag on the new turbines.\n[Vulture checks behind him but misses Spider-Man, who is hanging from a web attached to his back.]\nPeter: Ah! Whoa!\n[As Vulture goes higher and higher up, the night view of New York City gets smaller and smaller under Peter\u2019s feet.]\nMason: Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.\n[Vulture flies to the bottom of the plane and holds on. Peter bumps into the plane a few times, but manages to grab onto it.]\nPeter: Oh, my god! Oh, my god!\nMason: Deploy high-altitude vacuum seal.\nToomes: This better work, Mason.\n[The wing suit wraps around Vulture like a shell.]\nMason: Trust me, boss. Even one of those boxes and we are set for life.\nToomes: Yeah.\n[Vulture puts the matter phase shifter on the plane, creating a small rectangular window, and moves inside. Peter tries to follow Vulture, but loses his grip and almost falls off the plane.]\nPeter: Hey! Ah! Whew.\nMason: You have thirty seconds to get to the cockpit and override their security.\n[Vulture walks to the front and rips out the door. The cockpit is empty. Outside, we see a blown-up image of Spider-Man crawling down the plane. He must have been caught the cloaking cameras. He approaches the wing suit and tries to open it. Vulture connects a device to the plane.]\nToomes: Cloning transponder signal.\nMason: Launching decoy drone.\n[A small drone is launched out from the wing suit, startling Peter.]\nToomes: Entering new coordinates.\n[Vulture manipulates the cockpit dashboard, piloting the plane off track.]\n[A computer monitor displays the flight course in Avengers Tower.]\nHappy: Good, so it\u2019s on its way?\nTech: Yes, sir, right on course.\nHappy: Okay, thank you. All right.\n[The tech takes the laptop and leaves the almost-empty room.]\n[Peter is still struggling to open the wing suit. Inside the plane, Vulture finds the boxes and takes off his mask.]\nToomes: Hot dog.\n[Vulture opens one box after another. Rows and rows of Chitauri guns, arc reactors, etc. He takes out an Iron Man mask and throws it on the floor. Peter kicks Vulture\u2019s wing suit and pushes it aside a bit. The air pressure inside the cabin drops, activating the alarm. Vulture checks an external monitor and realizes that Peter has followed him. He growls in anger.]\n[Vulture comes out and puts on his wing suit. Peter tries to hang onto the airplane.]\nPeter: Just a typical homecoming on the outside of an invisible jet... Fighting my girlfriend\u2019s dad.\n[Vulture comes at him and takes out panels right above his head. Peter shoots his web at Vulture. Peter is now suspended in air, one hand holding onto the web sticking to the plane, another hand holding onto the web glued to Vulture. The webs snap off and Peter is sucked in towards the engines.]\nPeter: Oh, god!\n[He shoots his web to stop the propellers. Vulture, who was also dragged to the engines, escapes death, but his wing suit is a bit damaged. Hanging onto propeller blades laced with spiderweb, Peter sighs in relief.]\nPeter: Whew. I can\u2019t believe that worked.\n[Suddenly, the propeller falls off. Peter avoids the crisis by holding onto the plane and kicking the propeller off his body. Vulture flies back and attacks Peter. Peter avoids them, but Vulture keeps coming at him. The impact sets one of the engines on fire. Peter clings onto the side of the engine with a thin strand of web.]\nMason: Chief, chief, they\u2019re losing altitude. Get out of there.\nToomes: I\u2019m not going home empty-handed.\n[Vulture sets to break open the ceiling of the plane. Still hanging from the engine, Peter sees the plane flying straight at the city.]\nPeter: Oh, my god.\n[Peter shoots his web at the right wing of the plane and pulls on it to change the plane\u2019s direction. On the streets, passersby watch the plane flying overhead. Vulture tears open the ceiling and holds a box in his claws.]\nMason: Get out of there! What are you doing?\n[Peter continues to struggle with the plane.]\nPeter: Please turn! Please turn!\n[The plane narrowly misses crashing into the city and heads toward Coney Island. Instead of escaping, Vulture tries to hold onto a box.]\n[Happy, sitting comfortably in a chair, jumps up. He looks out and sees Tony\u2019s plane flying straight at Coney Island.]\n[The plane hits a ride and crash-lands on the beach of Coney Island. Peter loses hold of the plane and rolls down the beach. Everything is consumed in smoke and flames. Peter slowly gets up and takes off his mask. His ears are ringing. He has just staggered up to his feet when, suddenly, Vulture flies toward him and attacks him. Sparks fly from Vulture\u2019s wings; it is clear that he has suffered some serious damage, too.]\nToomes: Hey, Pedro.\n[Vulture continues to attack Peter. Peter shoots his web, but misses and gets pinned to the ground like a bird of prey. He screams as Vulture grabs him tightly with his claws and rains down punches at him. When Peter grabs Vulture\u2019s fist to prevent another blow, Vulture flies up and lets go of him. Peter avoids serious injury by shooting a strand of web and holding on to Vulture, but Vulture cuts it off and throws him to the ground. He then slams Peter into the ground a few times. Peter flips onto his back in a sluggish way, then looks up at Vulture, who picks him up by the hood of his Spider-Man costume. Vulture is holding Peter there, studying his limp body, when he spots a crate.]\nToomes: Bingo.\n[Vulture lets go of Peter, takes his goggles off, and grabs the crateful of arc reactors. Sparks rain down from his wing suit when he tries to lift the crate, but Vulture does not stop.]\nPeter: Your wing suit. Your wing suit\u2019s gonna explode!\n[Lifting his weary arm, Peter shoots a strand of web at the crate and pulls with all his might. A tug of war ensues.]\nToomes: Time to go home, Pete.\nPeter: I\u2019m trying to save you!\n[Vulture cuts the web with his wing and tries to fly off. Peter presses the button on his web shooter, but it doesn\u2019t work. He looks up to see the wing suit failing and covers his head. Vulture drops to the ground along with his wing suit. An explosion consumes him.]\nPeter: No.\n[Peter struggles up and runs into the flames. He spots Toomes and tries to lift the wing suit off him, but screams as he makes contact with hot metal. However, he doesn\u2019t give up. He picks the wing suit up, finds Toomes, and carries him away from the flames. Peter lays Toomes down on the beach. Wheezing and coughing from the smoke, Toomes looks up at Peter, who returns his gaze.]\n[The flames have died out a little. A search party is scouring the beach. Happy finds Vulture tied to a pile of crates with spiderweb. A note is attached beside him: \u201cFOUND FLYING VULTURE GUY. SPIDER-MAN. P.S. SORRY ABOUT YOUR PLANE.\u201d Happy raises his head and looks around as if searching for someone.]\n[Fire engines pass by the Cyclone. Peter is sitting on top of it. He closes his eyes, wounded and weary.]\n[Midtown High. Students are taking down a homecoming banner. Below it, Ned and Peter walk down the corridor.]\nNed: It looked so insane. That whole... Like, it was just crazy. He, he was just like, \u201cZzzz,\u201d and you were like, \u201cAh!\u201d\nPeter: Shh.\nNed: And then I just hit him with the \u201cpew.\u201d It was so, oh, my god.\nPeter: You saved me. It was awesome.\n[Peter spots Liz at the end of the corridor. Her mom is walking beside her with a box full of her belongings. Betty runs to Liz and hugs her. Peter runs toward them.]\nPeter: Hey, Liz!\nBetty: I\u2019m gonna miss you.\nLiz: Bye.\nPeter: Liz.\n[Liz waits for Peter, wiping tears off her face.]\nPeter: Liz, look. I\u2019m so sorry.\nLiz: You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time?\n[When Peter fails to answer:]\nLiz: The dance? That was a pretty crappy thing to do.\nPeter: Well, yeah, but I... I mean, your dad... I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through. If there\u2019s anything I can do to help...\nLiz: (fighting tears) I guess we\u2019re moving to Oregon. Mom says it\u2019s nice there, so that\u2019s cool. Anyways, Dad doesn\u2019t want us here during the trial, so...\nPeter: Liz, I... I...\nLiz: Bye, Peter. Whatever\u2019s going on with you, I hope you figure it out.\n[Liz leaves the school with her mother. Peter watches her go.]\n[In the library, Mr. Harrington brings the Decathlon trophy to a table of students.]\nMr. Harrington: Congratulations, Decathlon national champions.\nDecathlon Team: (clapping) Yeah!\nMr. Harrington: I\u2019m gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon, but just for motivation right now at this practice. I\u2019m a little ahead of the game, but we will need a new team captain next year. So I\u2019m appointing Michelle.\n[The students turn to Michelle and clap.]\nDecathlon Team: Yeah!\nMichelle: Uh, thank you. My friends call me M.J.\nNed: I thought you didn\u2019t have any friends.\nMichelle: I didn\u2019t.\n[Peter\u2019s cell phone vibrates. He picks the broken phone up and reads a message from an unknown number: \u201cGo to the bathroom.\u201d]\nPeter: I... I gotta go.\nMichelle: Hey, where you going?\n[Peter freezes as he thinks of an excuse. Michelle stares at him, eyes filled with suspicion.]\nMichelle: What are you hiding, Peter?\n[Peter\u2019s lips open, but no sound comes out. Suddenly, a grin breaks out on Michelle\u2019s face.]\nMichelle: I\u2019m just kidding. I don\u2019t care. Bye. (to Decathlon team) All right, so we should run some drills.\nNed: Yeah.\n[Michelle watches with curious eyes as Peter stands to leave.]\n[Peter rounds the corner and finds Happy waiting for him in the bathroom.]\nPeter: Hey, Happy. What, uh... What are you doing here?\nHappy: I really owe you one. I don\u2019t know what I would do without this job. I mean, before I met Tony-\n[A toilet flushes and cuts him off. They awkwardly stand there as Tiny McKeever comes out, washes his hands, wipes them, and leaves the bathroom, throwing a long, confused glance at them. Finally:]\nPeter: So, uh, how long you been here?\nHappy: Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.\nPeter: (whispers) Is he here too?\nHappy: In the toilet? No, he\u2019s upstate.\nPeter: Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?\nHappy: Yeah, let\u2019s go.\n[Inside Happy's car. Dashboard display says: \u201cYou may take your hands off the steering wheel.\u201d]\nHappy: Take a look. It\u2019s pretty impressive, huh?\n[Outside the window, we see the New Avengers Facility.]\nHappy: They just finished remodeling the whole thing.\n[Peter studies the facility with an awed expression. We see the reflection of a Quinjet taking off.]\n[Inside the compound, Peter watches a Quinjet fly off with a huge grin.]\nHappy: You don\u2019t see that every day.\n[Tony approaches them.]\nTony: Oh, there they are. How was the ride up?\nHappy: Good.\nTony: Give me a minute with the kid.\nHappy: Seriously?\nTony: Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid.\nHappy: I\u2019ll be close behind.\nTony: How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.\n[Tony playfully punches Peter in the shoulder, then puts an arm around him.]\nTony: Sorry I took your suit. I mean, you had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was the perfect sort of tough-love moment that you needed, right? To urge you on, right? Wouldn\u2019t you think? Don\u2019t you think?\nPeter: Yeah, yeah, I guess.\nTony: Let\u2019s just say it was.\n[Tony sighs and continues leading Peter towards a door.]\nPeter: Mr. Stark, I really-\nTony: You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. (beat) I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team.\nPeter: To the... To the team?\nTony: Yeah. Anyway... (points at a door) There\u2019s about fifty reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers.\n[He presses some buttons on his watch and a secret compartment in the wall opens, revealing a brand new Spider-Man suit, the Iron Spider Armor.]\nTony: When you\u2019re ready... Why don\u2019t you try that on? And I\u2019ll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers: Spider-Man.\nPeter: I...\n[Peter chuckles, amazed.]\nTony: Yeah. Give that a look.\n[Peter continues to admire the Iron Spider Armor.]\nTony: So, after the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. (to Happy) Where\u2019s he between? He\u2019s next to Vision?\nHappy: Yeah, Vision\u2019s not big on doors.\nTony: It\u2019s fun.\nHappy: Or walls.\nTony: (to Peter) You\u2019ll fit right in.\n[Peter hesitates for a moment, then turns to Tony.]\nPeter: Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I\u2019m good.\nTony: You\u2019re good? Good? How are you good?\nPeter: Well, I mean, I\u2019m... I\u2019d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody\u2019s got to look out for the little guy, right?\n[Tony takes off his sunglasses and stares into Peter\u2019s eyes.]\nTony: You turning me down? You better think about this. (pointing at the new Spider-Man suit) Look at that. Look at me. Last chance, yes or no?\nPeter: No.\nTony: Okay. It\u2019s kind of a Springsteen-y, working class hero vibe that I dig. Uh, Happy will take you home. Yeah?\nHappy: Yeah. (to Peter) Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.\nPeter: Thank you, Mr. Stark.\nTony: Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well.\n[Tony and Peter shake hands.]\nPeter: See you around.\nTony: Okay.\n[Peter starts to leave with a spring in his step, but then slows to a stop and turns to Tony, who is putting the Iron Spider Armor away with a tap on his watch.]\nPeter: That was a test, right? There\u2019s, uh, nobody back there?\nTony: Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck.\nPeter: Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.\nTony: Yeah, thank you.\n[Peter walks away.]\nHappy: Told you he\u2019s a good kid.\n[Tony shrugs. A door behind him opens, revealing a room full of reporters. We can hear their excited murmurs. Pepper comes out with a somewhat frenzied, annoyed look when she realizes that Peter is not there.]\nPepper: Where\u2019s the kid?\nHappy: He left.\nPepper: Everybody\u2019s waiting.\nTony: You know what? He actually made a really mature choice. It just surprised the heck out of us.\nPepper: Did you guys screw this up?\nTony: (points at Happy) He told the kid to go wait in the car.\nPepper: Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people in there waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?\nTony: Think of something. How about, um... Hap, you still got that ring?\nHappy: Do I... I, uh...\n[Happy makes a show of patting his pockets to find the ring.]\nTony: The engagement ring?\nHappy: Are you kidding? I\u2019ve been carrying this since 2008.\n[He holds up the engagement ring. Beat, then:]\nTony: Okay.\nPepper: I think I can think of something better than that.\nTony: Well, it would buy us a little time.\n[Pepper kisses Tony with a smile on her lips.]\nTony: Like we need time.\nPepper: I can\u2019t believe you have that thing in your pocket.\n[She starts to walk back towards the conference room.]\nTony: Want me to get the door for you, hon?\nPepper: I got it.\n[Tony quickly follows her, catching the ring that Happy throws to him.]\n[Peter walks out of the facility. A smile blossoms on his face.]\nPeter: Aunt May, did you do dinner already?\n[Peter enters his apartment and throws his keys on a table. He stops when he finds a brown paper bag that says \u201cThis belongs to you. -TS\u201d sitting on his bed. Taking out his earphones, Peter calls out:]\nPeter: May?\n[No answer. Peter gets into his Spider-Man suit, then pulls off the mask. Reveal May standing in the doorway behind him.]\nMay: What the fu...?\n[Prison. Toomes walks through a cell block. Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, approaches.]\nGargan: Look who it is! What are the odds you and I\u2019d end up in the same summer camp? Relax. This? (points at the scar on his forehead) It\u2019s not on you. It\u2019s on our, uh... little spider friend. I\u2019ve got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him. You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer. And I heard a rumor... you know who he is.\n[Toomes smiles almost imperceptibly.]\nToomes: If I knew who he was, he\u2019d already be dead.\n[Gargan stares at him with one eye severely bloodshot.]\nGuard: Toomes, your family\u2019s here.\n[Toomes walks away, smiling.]\nAn empty white screen. Captain America enters frame in his uniform.\nSteve: Hi. I\u2019m Captain America. Here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have. Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little. It seems like it\u2019s not worth it. And you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.\n[He uncomfortably glares at someone off-screen.]\nSteve: How many more of these?\n[Cut to black.]\nSpider-Man will return"

There\u2019s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop\u2026\nChristine Everhart (V.O.): Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?\nTony (V.O.): Yes\nMOSCOW\nChristine (V.O.): And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle\u2026\nTony (V.O.): I know that it\u2019s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I\u2019m a superhero.\nSwitch to view of a TV\nTony (on TV): I mean, let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I\u2019ve made, largely public. The truth is\u2026 I am Iron Man.\nAnton Vanko [Russian]: Ivan. Vanya. That should be you.\nIvan Vanko [Russian]: Don\u2019t listen to that crap\nAnton Vanko [Russian]: I\u2019m sorry. All I can give you is my knowledge.\n(Anton coughs and dies. Ivan is naturally distraught. Takes a swig of vodka. Pulls out blueprints for an arc reactor. Engineering montage as opening credits roll.)\n\nIRON MAN 2\n\nMan (V.O): 270 at 30 knots.

And he jumps out said aeroplane, landing on a stage. All very ostentatious. Dancing girls. Fireworks.)\nSTARK EXPO \u2013 FLUSHING, NEW YORK.\n(Dismantling Iron Man suit.)\nPretty much everyone in the crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!\nTony: It\u2019s good to be back. You missed me?\nMan in crowd: Blow something up!\nTony: I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I\u2019m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I\u2019m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I\u2019m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven\u2019t come across anyone who\u2019s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.\nWoman in crowd: I love you Tony!\nTony: Please, it\u2019s not about me. [People still cheering Tony] It\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s not even about us. It\u2019s about legacy. It\u2019s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that\u2019s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It\u2019s not about us. Therefore, what I\u2019m saying, if I\u2019m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo. [Big cheer from crowd.] And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it\u2019s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.\nHoward Stark (on a screen, courtesy of a video recording): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind, [Tony is off the stage, doing something. Blood toxicity test. Gives a reading of 19%. Not good] and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.\n\n\n[Video ends. Cut to news feed of reporter outside.]\nReporter: We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I\u2019m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.\n\nHappy Hogan: Make sure you join me\u2026\nTony: All right, it\u2019s a zoo out there, watch out.\nHappy: Open up, let\u2019s go.\n[Image is Tony trying to pass through the crowd, from Tony\u2019s perspective.]\nTony: Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.\nPeople: Tony, Tony\nTony: Hey, hey.\nWoman: Call me.\nHappy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.\nTony: [signing a picture of Iron Man] Hello. It would be a pleasure.\nHappy: Okay\nTony: [what would be ruffling the hair of a small boy if said small boy were not wearing an Iron Man helmet making hair unreachable] See you buddy\nHappy: This is Larry.\nTony: Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.\nLarry: Call me. Call me.\nHappy: Larry King.\nTony: Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.\nHappy: [Scene shows them finally at the door] Come on, Tony. There we go.\nTony: Very mellow.\nHappy: That wasn\u2019t so bad.\nTony: No, it was perfect.\nHappy: Look what we got here, the new model.\nTony: Hey, does she come with the car?\nHappy: I certainly hope so. Hi.\nTony: Hi. And you are?\nWoman: Marshal.\nTony: Irish. I like it.\nMarshal: Pleased to meet you Tony.\nTony: I\u2019m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?\nMarshal: Bedford.\nTony: What are you doing here?\nMarshal: Looking for you.\nTony: Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?\nMarshal: Serving subpoenas. [Hands him a letter. Tony doesn\u2019t take it]\nTony: Yikes.\nHappy: [Reaching over and taking the letter] He doesn\u2019t like to be handed things.\nTony: Yeah, I have a peeve.\nMarshal: I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.\nTony: Can I see a badge?\nMarshal: You wanna see the badge?\nHappy: He likes the badge.\nMarshal: [showing him her badge.] You still like it?\nTony: Yep. [Starts engine] How far are we from D.C.?\nHappy: D.C.? 250 miles.\n[Drive off. Image slides over, like when you used to make Powerpoints with all the transitions. It now shows Washing D.C. You can tell because words appear saying\u2026]\nWASHINGTON D.C.\nSenator Stern: Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.\nTony: [turns around from where he was trying to talk to Pepper who looks like she was trying to tell him off.] Yes dear?\nSenator Stern: Can I have your attention?\nTony: Absolutely.\nStern: Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?\nTony: I do not.\nStern: You do not?\nTony: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.\nStern: The Iron Man weapon.\nTony: My device does not fit that description.\nStern: Well\u2026 How would you describe it?\nTony: I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.\nStern: As?\nTony: It\u2019s a high-tech prosthesis. That is\u2026 That is\u2026 That\u2019s actually the most apt description I can make of it.\nStern: It\u2019s a weapon. It\u2019s a weapon, Mr Stark.\nTony: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen\u2026\nStern: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.\nTony: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you\u2019re in. You can\u2019t have it.\nStern: Look, I\u2019m no expert\u2026\nTony: In prostitution? Of course not. You\u2019re a senator. Come on.\n[People laugh. He waves. Pepper does not look impressed at all. He mouths \u201cno?\u201d and she shakes her head.]\nStern: I\u2019m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I\u2019d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.\nTony: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.\nJustin Hammer: Absolutely. I\u2019m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You\u2019re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let\u2019s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we\u2019re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it\u2019s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I\u2019d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain\u2019t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.\nStern: That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.\nTony: Rhodey? What?\n[Rhodey walks in, Tony gets up to greet him] \\\nTony: Hey, buddy. I didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\nRhodey: Look, it\u2019s me, I\u2019m here. Deal with it. Let\u2019s move on.\nTony: I just\u2026\nRhodey: Drop it.\nTony: All right, I\u2019ll drop it.\nStern: I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?\nRhodey: You\u2019re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?\nStern: Yes, sir.\nRhodey: It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.\nStern: I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read\u2026\nRhodey: You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final\u2026\nStern: Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.\nRhodey: Very well. \u201cAs he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.\u201d I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest\u2026\nStern: That\u2019s enough Colonel\nRhodey: \u2026to fold Mr Stark\u2026\nStern: That\u2019s enough\nRhodey: \u2026into the existing chain of command, Senator.\nTony: I\u2019m not a joiner, but I\u2019ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.\n[Laughs from crowd.]\nTony: We can amend the hours a little bit.\nStern: I\u2019d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that\u2019s connected to your report.\nRhodey: I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.\nStern: With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we\u2019d be very grateful. Let\u2019s have the images.\nRhodey: Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark\u2019s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground\u2026\n[Tony is doing something on a Stark device]\nRhodey: \u2026 indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.\nTony: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. [Sets up his device to connect with the screen showing the pictures.] Boy, I\u2019m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let\u2019s see what\u2019s really going on.\nStern: What is he doing?\nTony: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that\u2019s North Korea. [Video of a suit. It falls over and clearly doesn\u2019t work very well at all.]\nStern: Can you turn that off? Take it off. [Justin Hammer stands up]\nTony: Iran.\n[This suit can fly. For all of five seconds before crashing, judging by the smoke, probably on fire. Justin is by the screen, trying to find the off switch.]\nTony: No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?\n[Yep, it\u2019s a video of Justin Hammer. With a suit. Again that really doesn\u2019t work.]\nTony: Justin, you\u2019re on TV. Focus up.\nTV Justin: Okay, give me a left twist. Left\u2019s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.\n[Language Justin]\nTony: [Just as not-TV Justin finds the plug and unplugs the screen] Wow. Yeah, I\u2019d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.\nJustin: I\u2019d like to point out that that test pilot survived.\nStern: I think we\u2019re done is the point that he\u2019s making. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason\u2026\nTony: The point is, you\u2019re welcome, I guess\nStern: For what?\nTony: Because I\u2019m your nuclear deterrent. It\u2019s working. We\u2019re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can\u2019t have it. But I did you a big favour.\n[Stands up and turns around to face the crowd]\nTony: I\u2019ve successfully privatised world peace.\n[Both hands make peace signs and everyone stands up, all talking at once]\nTony: What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.\nStern: [beep] you, Mr Stark. [beep] you, buddy. We\u2019re adjourned. We\u2019re adjourned for today.\nTony: [puts on sunglasses. Rhodey\u2019s still sitting down and has the same look on his face as Pepper did. Basically, they\u2019re both tired of Tony not taking serious things seriously] Okay.\nStern: You\u2019ve been a delight.\n[Kind of scene change. It\u2019s now on a television on a Russian news channel with Russian dubbing. Because it\u2019s a film where the selected language is English, we can still here the English clearer than the Russian. We\u2019re back to Ivan.]\nTony (on TV): My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve proven it\u2019s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.\n[Ivan is still working. There\u2019s things going blue. It works. It\u2019s not a full suit, but it does now look like he has whips made of lightning.\nScene change. Tony\u2019s house. He\u2019s in his workshop. Pans in from across the ocean]\nMALIBU, CALIFORNIA\nTony: Wake up, Daddy\u2019s home.\nJarvis (V.O., A.I): Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.\n[One of the robots is trying to make a smoothie. Without a blender lid]\nTony: You!\n[You knocks over the blender. Well, he tried.]\nTony: I swear to God I\u2019ll dismantle you. I\u2019ll soak your motherboard. I\u2019ll turn you into a wine rack.\n[You looks down, sad.]\nTony: How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?\nJarvis: We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.\n[Tony downs green liquid]\nTony: Check palladium levels.\n[Using the same machine as before]\nJarvis: Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.\nTony: [Takes Arc Reactor out of chest. The core pops out, rusted and slightly smoking.] God, they\u2019re running out quick.\nJarvis: I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.\n[Tony inputs a new core. It\u2019s silver, giving a judgment of just how badly damaged the other one was. Replaces Arc Reactor in chest.]\nJarvis: You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that\u2019s keeping you alive is also killing you.\n[Which we can see from the image of Tony\u2019s chest on the computer screen. There\u2019s blue lines all around the Arc Reactor. Camera angle shifts to focus on his actual chest.]\nJarvis: Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her\u2026\nTony: Mute.\n[Shirt back down, computers switched to screen saver, Pepper inputs a code and opens the door]\nPepper: Is this a joke? What are you thinking?\nTony: What?\nPepper: What are you thinking?\nTony: Hey, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m busy. And you\u2019re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don\u2019t want to get sick.\nPepper: Did you just donate\u2026\nTony: Keep your business.\n[Both walking around the room]\nPepper: \u2026our entire modern art collection to the\u2026\nTony: Boy Scouts of America.\nPepper: \u2026Boy Scouts of America?\nTony: Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn\u2019t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it\u2019s not \u201cour\u201d collection, it\u2019s my collection. No offence.\nPepper: No, you know what? I think I\u2019m actually entitled to say \u201cour\u201d collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.\nTony: It was a tax write-off. I needed that.\nPepper: You know, there\u2019s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.\nTony: [to another robot] Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport\u2019s already machining that part.\nPepper: The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.\nTony: I need you to wear a surgical mask until you\u2019re feeling better. Is that okay?\nPepper: That\u2019s rude.\nTony: There\u2019s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It\u2019s my primary point of concern. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re\u2026\nPepper: The Expo is your ego gone crazy.\nTony: [Picking up a painting. Of Iron Man] Wow. Look at that. That\u2019s modern art. That\u2019s going up.\nPepper: You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\nTony: I\u2019m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.\nPepper: Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?\nTony: No. Our stocks have never been higher.\nPepper: Yes, from a managerial standpoint.\nTony: You are\u2026 Well, if\u2019s messy then let\u2019s double back.\nPepper: Let me give you an example.\nTony: Let\u2019s move onto another subject.\nPepper: No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.\nTony: I\u2019m not taking it down. I\u2019m just replacing it with this.\n[Tony is now stood on a desk about to take down the Barnett Newman to put the Iron Man picture up].\nTony: Let\u2019s see what I can get going on here.\nPepper: Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.\nTony: Yeah. Don\u2019t say \u201cwind farm.\u201d I\u2019m already feeling gassy.\nPepper: And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll\u2026\nTony: Everything was my idea.\nPepper: \u2026and you won\u2019t make a decision.\nTony: I don\u2019t care about the liberal agenda any more. It\u2019s boring. Boring. I\u2019m giving you a boring alert. [Jumps off desk] You do it.\nPepper: I do what?\nTony: Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.\nPepper: Yeah, I\u2019m trying to run the company.\nTony: Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.\nPepper: You will not give me the information\u2026\nTony: I\u2019m not asking you to try\u2026\nPepper: \u2026in order to\u2026\nTony: I\u2019m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.\nPepper: I am trying to do it.\nTony: Pepper, you\u2019re not listening to me!\nPepper: No, you are not listening to me.\nTony: I\u2019m trying to make you CEO. Why won\u2019t you let me?\nPepper: Have you been drinking?\nTony: Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I\u2019ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. [One of the robots brings him a tray which a bottle and glasses on it] Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it\u2019s you. It\u2019s always been you. [Pours champagne. Pepper sits down, shocked and confused]. I thought there\u2019d be a legal issue, but actually I\u2019m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. [Hands her a glass. She doesn\u2019t take it.] Congratulations? Take it, just take it.\nPepper: I don\u2019t know what to think.\nTony: Don\u2019t think, drink. There you go. [They tap glasses and drink]\n[We\u2019re back in Russia. A man hands Ivan a letter down a twitten, out of sight. It contains a fake passport and a ticket\nAnother scene change. Tony and Happy are boxing. Pepper walks in.]\nPepper: The notary\u2019s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?\nTony: I\u2019m on happy time. [Tony hits Happy in the face with his elbow] Sorry.\nHappy: What the hell was that?\nTony: It\u2019s called mixed martial arts. It\u2019s been around for three weeks.\nHappy: It\u2019s called dirty boxing, there\u2019s nothing new about it\nTony: All right, put them up. Come on. [A woman walks in. Both Happy and Tony\u2019s attention shifts to her]\nPepper: I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.\nNotary: I need you to initial each box.\nHappy: [Taps Tony on the back of the head with a light punch, not enough to hurt him] Lesson one. Never take your eye off\u2026 [Tony kicks him and he goes crashing into the corner of the ring. Camera angle shifts to Pepper and the Notary and clangs are heard.]\nTony: That\u2019s it. I\u2019m done. What\u2019s your name lady?\nNotary: Rushman. Natalie Rushman [So we shall now refer to Notary as Natalie]\nTony: Front and centre. Come into the church.\nPepper: No. You\u2019re seriously not gonna ask\u2026\nTony: If it pleases the court, which it does.\nNatalie: [To Pepper] It\u2019s no problem.\nPepper: [To Natalie] I\u2019m sorry. He\u2019s very eccentric.\n[Natalie enters ring. Tony swigs down more green liquid out of a bottle]\nTony: Can you give her a lesson?\nHappy: No problem.\nTony: [Steps out of ring and towards Pepper] Pepper.\nPepper: What?\nTony: [Sitting down next to Pepper] Who is she?\nPepper: She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.\nTony: I need a new assistant, boss.\nPepper: Yes, and I\u2019ve got three excellent potential candidates. They\u2019re lined up and ready to meet you.\nTony: I don\u2019t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it\u2019s her.\nPepper: No it\u2019s not.\nHappy: You ever boxed before?\nNatalie: I have, yes.\nHappy: What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie\u2019s face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her]\nTony: How do I spell your name, Natalie?\nNatalie: R-U-S-H-M-A-N.\nPepper: What, are you gonna google her now?\nTony: I thought I was ogling her. [Brings up Natalie\u2019s file on table which doubles up as a computer. He has computers on everything.] Wow. Very, very impressive individual.\nPepper: You\u2019re so predictable, you know that?\nTony: She\u2019s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?\nPepper: No one speaks Latin.\nTony: No one speaks Latin\nPepper: It\u2019s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can\u2019t speak Latin.\nTony: Did you model in Tokyo? \u2018Cause she modelled in Tokyo.\nPepper: Well\u2026\nTony: I need her. She\u2019s got everything that I need. [Camera is now on Natalie and Happy, Natalie looking over, hearing what Tony is saying]\nHappy: Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent. [He goes to take a swing, she grabs his hand and flips him over, legs over his head.]\nPepper: Oh, my God! Happy.\nTony: That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\nHappy: I just slipped.\nTony: You did?\nHappy: [Who looks a little like he\u2019s in pain] Yeah.\nTony: Looks like a TKO to me. [Rings bell Natalie leaves ring]\nNatalie: Just\u2026 I need your impression.\nTony: You have a quiet reserve. I don\u2019t know, you have an old soul.\nNatalie: I meant your fingerprint.\nTony: Right.\nPepper: So, how are we doing?\nTony: Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You\u2019re the boss.\nNatalie: Will that be all, Mr Stark?\nTony: No.\nPepper: Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. [She leaves. Tony turns to Pepper]\nTony: I want one.\nPepper: No.\n[News report is heard. In French. It\u2019s about the Grand Prix. \nTony, Pepper and Happy are seen leaving a car and walking into a building. Happy is carrying a red suitcase]\nTony: You know, it\u2019s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.\nPepper: Go with it? Go with what?\nNatalie: Mr Stark?\nTony: Hey.\nNatalie: Hello. How was your flight?\nTony: It was excellent. Boy, it\u2019s nice to see you.\nNatalie: We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don\u2019t mind. Okay?\nPepper: When did this happen?\nTony: What? You made me do it.\nPepper: I made you do what?\nTony: You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don\u2019t flare your nostrils.\nPepper: You are so predictable.\nTony: That\u2019s the amazing thing.\nNatalie: Right this way.\nTony: You look fantastic.\nNatalie: Why, thank you very much.\nTony: But that\u2019s unprofessional. What\u2019s on the docket?\nNatalie: You have a 9:30 dinner.\nTony: Perfect. I\u2019ll be there at 11:00.\nNatalie: Absolutely.\nTony: Is this us?\nNatalie: It can be.\nTony: Great. Make it us.\nNatalie: Okay.\nPepper: Mr Musk. How are you?\nMr Musk: Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion.\nPepper: Thank you very much.\nTony: Elon, how\u2019s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.\nMr Musk: Thank you. Yeah, I\u2019ve got an idea for an electric jet.\nTony: You do?\nMr Musk: Yeah.\nTony: Then we\u2019ll make it work. [To Pepper as they walk] You want a massage?\nPepper: Oh, God. No. I don\u2019t want a massage.\nTony: I\u2019ll have Natalie make an\u2026\nPepper: I don\u2019t want Natalie to do\u2026\nTony: Don\u2019t want you tense. By the way, I didn\u2019t mean to spring this on you.\nPepper: Thank you very much.\nTony: Green is not your best colour. [Justin\u2019s head appears from behind someone]\nPepper: Oh, please.\nJustin: Anthony. Is that you?\nTony: [To Pepper] My least favourite person on Earth.\nJustin: Hey, pal.\nTony: Justin Hammer.\nJustin: How you doing? You\u2019re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other? [She appears.]\nChristine: Hi. Yes.\nPepper: Yes.\nTony: Yes, roughly.\nPepper: We do.\nJustin: BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.\nChristine: I know, I know.\nJustin: Congratulations.\nChristine: My editor will kill me if I don\u2019t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.\nPepper: Oh.\nChristine: Can I?\nPepper: Sure.\nJustin: She\u2019s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I\u2019d throw her a bone, you know. Right?\nPepper: Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.\nTony: And she wrote a story as well.\nPepper: It was very impressive.\nTony: That was good.\nPepper: It was very well done.\nChristine: Thank you.\nPepper: I\u2019m gonna go wash.\nTony: Don\u2019t leave me.\nJustin: Hey, buddy. How you doing?\nTony: I\u2019m all right.\nJustin: Looking gorgeous.\nTony: Please, this is tough.\nChristine: Can I ask you\u2026 Is this the first time\u2026\nJustin: [Posing for a camera while Tony replaces sunglasses and tries to escape] Fromage [French for cheese. That bit did have a subtitle] Say \u201cBrie\u201d.\nChristine: \u2026that you guys have seen each other?\nTony: God, that\u2019s so awful.\nChristine: Listen, is it the first time you\u2019ve seen each other since the Senate?\nTony: Since he got his contract revoked\u2026\nJustin: Actually, it\u2019s on hold.\nTony: \u2026when you were attempting to\u2026That\u2019s not what I heard. What\u2019s the difference between \u201chold and \u201ccancelled\u201d? The truth?\nChristine: Yes, what is it?\nJustin: No. The truth is\u2026 Why don\u2019t we put that away? The truth is, I\u2019m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.\nTony: Well, if you invent something that works, I\u2019ll make sure I get you a slot.\nNatalie: Mr Stark?\nTony: Yes?\nNatalie: Your corner table is ready.\nJustin: I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.\nTony: Hammer needs a slot, Christine.\nJustin: We kid, yeah. We kid. We\u2019re kidders.\n[Tony is doing another test. It reads Blood toxicity 53%. He\u2019s in a bathroom.]\nTony: [In the mirror] Got any other bad ideas?\n[And now he\u2019s in a racing suit, jumping over the barrier towards a car.]\nJustin: [Still inside, talking to Christine.] Tony and I\u2026 Tony\u2026 I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We\u2019re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do\u2026\nTony (on TV behind Justin): Well, what\u2019s the use of having\u2026\nJustin: \u2026is a healthy\u2026\nTony: \u2026and owning a race car\u2026\nJustin: \u2026competition.\nTony: \u2026if you don\u2019t drive it?\nJustin: Is he driving?\n[Camera shift to Pepper sitting at her table, probably waiting for Tony. She notices the television.]\nPepper: Natalie. Natalie!\nNatalie: Yes, Ms Potts?\nPepper: What do you know about this?\nNatalie: This is the first that I have known of it.\nPepper: This, this cannot happen.\nNatalie: Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?\nPepper: Where\u2019s Happy?\nNatalie: He\u2019s waiting outside.\nPepper: Okay, get him. I need Happy.\nNatalie: Right away.\nJustin: Tony\u2019s\u2026 You know, he\u2026 We\u2019re not competitive. You know what I mean?\nChristine: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?\nJustin: Just read me what you wrote.\nChristine: I will. I will, after.\nJustin: Just read it back to me.\nChristine: But I have to make one quick phone call.\nJustin: Where are you going?\nChristine: This is great.\nJustin: I\u2019ve got some caviar coming.\nChristine: This is great stuff. I\u2019ll be right back.\nSomeone in background: Look! That\u2019s Stark.\n[And engines revving, set, go! The race takes off. A man dressed in orange as pit crew walks beside the track. He looks familiar. Tony\u2019s surprisingly not bad at this race car driving. Orange man is on the track. Oh look, it\u2019s Ivan. More French words. I got a \u201cMon Dieu\u201d I think. The lightning whips strike a car. Pepper looks terrified. For Tony. Another \u201cMon Dieu\u201d from the French commentator. Means \u201cMy God\u201d by the way. Happy appears at the door and holds up the briefcase. Pepper goes with him to the car and gets in the back.]\nPepper: Go, go.\nHappy: Hang on. [Crashes through a barrier onto the track heading the opposite way to the race cars. Tony\u2019s car gets hit and he goes flying, loosing the front. Ivan heads forward. Another car gets hit. Bit of fire. Dripping petrol. Never a good sign.]\nPepper: Give me the case.\nHappy: Here, take it.\nPepper: Where\u2019s the key?\nHappy: It\u2019s in my pocket.\nPepper: Car!\n[Ivan slices more of Tony\u2019s car, but he\u2019s gone. Tony comes up from behind him and whacks him around the head with a sheet of metal. Fighting. Tony is knocked on the floor. Sees dripping petrol. Ivan begins to swings the whips. Tony moves, hits petrol and the car bursts into flames. Happy appears, driving and runs Ivan into the fence. Tony is up the fence]\nTony: Are you okay?\nHappy: Yeah.\nTony: Were you heading from me or him?\nHappy: I was trying to scare him.\nTony: \u2018Cause I can\u2019t tell!\nPepper: Are you out of your mind?\nTony: Better security.\nPepper: Get in the car right now!\nTony: I was attacked. We need better security.\nHappy: Get in the car.\nTony: You\u2019re CEO. Better security measures. God, it\u2019s embarrassing. [Ivan\u2019s head moves. Tony opens the door] First vacation in two years. [And Ivan slices the door in half. Darn it Ivan, it\u2019s a Rolls, be nicer to her]\nPepper: Oh my God! [Happy reverses a bit and runs into Ivan again.]\nHappy: I got him!\nTony: Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.\nHappy: I got him.\nPepper: Take the case! Take it!\nTony: Give him the case!\nPepper: Stop banging the car! [Out comes the airbag and Ivan slices the car in half. He continues to slice at the car]\nTony: Calm down.\nPepper: God. God.\nTony: Give me the case! Please! Come on! [Pepper throws the case, Tony stand on it and it turns into the Iron Man Suit! A fight begins. Which involves more damage to the car and damage to the Iron Man suit. Tony rips out the Arc Reactor, shutting off Ivan\u2019s suit.]\nIvan: [Being taken away by the police] You\u2026 You lose. You lose Stark. [Justin smiles.]\n[Scene change. In a prison.]\nPolice officer [French]: We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name.\nTony [French]: Where are we going?\nPolice Officer [French]: Over there. We\u2019re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn\u2019t said a word since he got here.\nTony [French]: Five minutes.\nPolice officer [French]: [opening door] Five minutes. {Door is shut behind Tony.]\nTony: Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It\u2019s effective. Not very efficient. But it\u2019s a passable knock-off. I don\u2019t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.\nIvan: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.\nTony: Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?\nIvan: My father. Anton Vanko.\nTony: Well, I never heard of him.\nIvan: My father is the reason you\u2019re alive.\nTony: The reason I\u2019m alive is \u2018cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.\nIvan: Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.\nTony: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That\u2019s right. A prison cell. I\u2019ll send you a bar of soap. [He gets up to leave]\nIvan: Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die. [Tony leaves the cell]\n[Scene change. On Tony\u2019s private aeroplane. Stern is on the television]\nStern: It\u2019s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he\u2019s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can\u2019t exist anywhere else, don\u2019t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, \u201cThese suits exist now.\u201d\nTony: Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That\u2019s the truth.\nPepper: What is that?\nTony: This is your in-flight meal.\nPepper: Did you just make that?\nTony: Yeah. Where do you think I\u2019ve been for three hours?\nPepper: Tony, what are you not telling me?\nTony: I don\u2019t want to go home. At all. Let\u2019s cancel my birthday party and\u2026 We\u2019re in Europe. Let\u2019s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?\nPepper: Oh, yes.\nTony: It\u2019s a great place to be healthy.\nPepper: I don\u2019t think this is the right time. We\u2019re in kind of a mess.\nTony: Yeah, but maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s the best time. \u2018Cause then we can\u2026\nPepper: Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.\nTony: As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.\nPepper: A leave?\nTony: A company retreat.\nPepper: A retreat? During a time like this?\nTony: Just a ride. Well, I\u2019m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.\nPepper: Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.\n[Ivan is in a cell. A guard drops of food. Someone\u2019s left a note about enjoying the potatoes. That would be easier if they were potatoes and not an explosive. A man enters, dressed like Ivan, down to the number. Ivan escapes. More French shouting. There was defiantly an \u201callez\u201d in there. Ivan gets knocked out.\nHe awakens somewhere else]\nJustin: Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m such a huge fan of yours. I didn\u2019t want to make a first impression like this. He\u2019s not an animal. Come on. He\u2019s a human being. Thank you. We\u2019re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I\u2019d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?\nJack: We have some salmon carpaccio.\nJustin: Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It\u2019s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was\u2026 Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I\u2019d be listening. This is why I couldn\u2019t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don\u2019t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That\u2019s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I\u2019d like to be that guy.\nIvan: [Russian; no subs]\nJustin: Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don\u2019t know. Have you been understanding everything I\u2019m saying?\nIvan: Very good, man.\nJustin: Very good, man.\nIvan: Very good, man.\nJustin: Hey!\nIvan: [clinking bottle with Justin\u2019s glass] Hey.\nJustin: Yes?\nIvan: I want my bird.\nJustin: A bird? You want a bird?\nIvan: I want my bird.\nJustin: I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.\nIvan: I want my bird.\nJustin: Well, okay. Nothing\u2019s impossible. I could\u2026 Are we talking about\u2026 Is this a bird back in Russia?\n[Scene change. Pepper and Natalie are back in Malibu.]\nPepper: [on phone] Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco.\nNatalie: [also on phone. But a different phone] Yes, of course. [To Pepper] The AP wants a quote.\nPepper: [covers speaker] Don\u2019t tell them. Fax them\u2026\nRhodey: [entering] Where is he?\nNatalie: He doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\nPepper: He\u2019s downstairs.\nNews reader (on television): But what happened in Monaco?\nPepper: Yes, but\u2026.\nNews reader: But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, \u201cCan this man still protect us?\u201d\nPepper: Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.\n[Scene change. Tony is sitting in a car in his workshop looking at holograms.]\nJARVIS: Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist. [Rhodey enters]\nRhodey: Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I\u2019ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They\u2019re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They\u2019re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It\u2019s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?\nTony: Let\u2019s go. [Gets out the car. And falls.]\nRhodey: Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?\nTony: Yeah, I should get to my desk. [Rhodey supports him] See that cigar box?\nRhodey: Yeah.\nTony: It\u2019s palladium.\nRhodey: [Tony removes Arc Reactor] Is that supposed to be smoking?\nTony: If you must know, it\u2019s neutron damage. It\u2019s from the reactor wall.\nRhodey: You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?\nTony: Road rash. Thank you. [Replaces Arc Reactor and starts drinking green liquid again.] What are you looking at?\nRhodey: I\u2019m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it\u2019s unnecessary. You don\u2019t have to do this alone.\nTony: You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you\u2019ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I\u2019m doing.\nQUEENS, NEW YORK.\nJustin: This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I\u2019m very excited. They\u2019re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I\u2019m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around. [Ivan puts on glasses and heads towards a computer] You don\u2019t wanna do that. You\u2019ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I\u2026 Wow. Okay. Good stuff.\nIvan: [Something Russian]\nJustin: Sorry?\nIvan: Software shit.\nJustin: Well\u2026 You\u2019re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you\u2019re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That\u2019s something, isn\u2019t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They\u2019re $125.7 million a pop, so\u2026 Wait! [Ivan pulls off one\u2019s head] Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That\u2019s where the pilot goes. I\u2019m having a tough time finding volunteers. I\u2019ll take care of that, just leave it.\nIvan: What you want them do?\nJustin: Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark\u2019s front yard. You know what I\u2019m talking about?\nIvan: I can do that. No problem.\nJustin: Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn\u2019t I tell you? I had a feeling.\n[Tony\u2019s rash on his chest is getting worse. Natalie enters.]\nNatalie: Do you know which watch you\u2019d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?\nTony: I\u2019ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.\nNatalie: Probably.\nTony: Yeah. \u2018Cause it\u2019s\u2026\nNatalie: Ill-timed.\nTony: Right, sends the wrong message.\nNatalie: Inappropriate. [Tony drinks a bit of his drink that Natalie hands him] Is that dirty enough for you?\nTony: Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I\u2019ll give that a look. Bring them over. [Natalie hands him the box of watches] I\u2019ll take that. Why don\u2019t you\u2026 [She sits, smiles softly and starts helping him cover his bruise] I gotta say it. It\u2019s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?\nNatalie: Legal.\nTony: Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?\nNatalie: I\u2019d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with. [She leaves Tony finishes his drink. Scene change. He\u2019s now drunk, by a DJ, dancing in the suit. Cars pull up outside]\nPerson: Good evening\nPerson: Good evening\nRhodey: Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I\u2019ll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch. [Enters party] Hey Pepper.\nPepper: I\u2019m going to get some air.\nRhodey: What\u2019s wrong?\nPepper: [Showing Rhodey Tony] I don\u2019t know what to do.\nRhodey: You gotta be kidding me. [Tony falls over, drunk] That\u2019s it, I\u2019m making\u2026.\nPepper: No, no, no. Don\u2019t call anyone.\nRhodey: Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.\nPepper: I know. I know. I get it. I\u2019m gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it.\nRhodey: Handle it. Or I\u2019m gonna have to.\nTony: [To crowd] You know, the question I get asked most often is, \u201cTony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?\u201d Just like that. [Cheering. Pepper walks up to him]\nPepper: Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?\nTony: I love you.\nPepper: Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we\u2019re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.\nTony: No, no, no, we can\u2019t \u2026 Wait, wait, wait. We didn\u2019t have the cake. We didn\u2019t blow out the candles.\nPepper: You\u2019re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?\nTony: You\u2019re out of control gorgeous.\nPepper: It\u2019s time to go to bed. It\u2019s time.\nTony: Give me another smooch\nPepper: You\u2019re not going to be happy about this.\nTony: Come on, you know you want to.\nPepper: You just peed in the suit.\nTony: I know. It has a filtration system.\nPepper: It\u2019s not sexy.\nTony: You could drink that water.\nPepper: Just send everybody home, okay? It\u2019s time to\u2026\nTony: If you say so.\nPepper: Okay. I\u2019ll take this, you take that [exchanges microphone for bottle]\nTony: Pepper Potts. She\u2019s right. The party\u2019s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn\u2019t like it, there\u2019s the door. [accidently shoots it with the suit.] Yeah! [Girl throws bottle it the air] Hit! [Rhodey leaves as he shoots it] Pull! [Rhodey goes downstairs. Drunk girl is still throwing things for Tony to shoot. Rhodey gets into one of the suits. Another girl appears with a watermelon] I think she wants the Gallagher!\nRhodey: [In full suit] I\u2019m only gonna say this once. Get out. [Helmet slips down. Everybody leaves.] You don\u2019t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!\nTony: [To DJ] Goldstein.\nGoldstein: Yes, Mr Stark?\nTony: Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy\u2019s ass to. [Laughs. Another One Bites the Dust by Queen starts to play.]\nRhodey: [Grabbing hold on Tony from behind] I told you to shut it down. [Tony takes off backwards]\nTony: Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. [Rhodey throws things at him] Really? [Tony hits him with a set of weights] Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn\u2019t have a sidekick.\nRhodey: [Hitting Tony with a pipe] Sidekick this. [Tony goes up throw the ceiling.] Had enough?\n[Quick camera angle shift]\nPepper: Natalie!\nNatalie: Miss Potts.\nPepper: Don\u2019t you \u201cMiss Potts\u201d me! I\u2019m on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here\u2026 [Tony and Rhodey come crashing through the ceiling]\nHappy: Pepper! [Runs in to get her out of the way] Get out of here. Get out of here now. [Natalie heads off somewhere.]\nTony: You want it? Take it! [Beats Rhodey and turns to growl at crowd, who run off. Rhodey gets back up]\nRhodey: Put you hand down.\nTony: You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?\nRhodey: We don\u2019t have to do this, Tony.\nTony: You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.\nRhodey: Put it down!\nTony: You gonna take a shot?\nRhodey: Put it down!\nTony: No!\nRhodey: Drop it Tony!\nTony: Take it! [Their blasts meet and there goes Tony\u2019s house. Both of them are knocked backwards. Tony looks around and sees Rhodey take off in the suit.]\nEDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE\nMOJAVE, CA\nRhodey: Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet\u2026 [Rhodey lands in suit.]\nMajor Allen: Colonel.\nRhodey: Major.\nMajor Allen: Wow.\nRhodey: Yeah. Let\u2019s take it inside.\nMajor Allen: Clear the area.\n[Scene change. Tony is sitting inside a doughnut, eating a doughnut. Pans out to see Nick Fury looking up at him.]\nNick Fury: Sir! I\u2019m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.\nTony: [Now inside sitting at a table with Fury] I told you I don\u2019t wanna join your super-secret boy band.\nFury: No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How\u2019s that working out for you?\nTony: It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I\u2019m a bit hung over. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re real of if I\u2019m having\u2026\nFury: I am very real. I\u2019m the realest person you\u2019re ever gonna meet.\nTony: Just my luck. Where\u2019s the staff here?\nFury: That\u2019s not looking so good.\nTony: I\u2019ve been worse. [A woman walks over. Camera angle is such that you can\u2019t see her face.]\nSHIELD agent: We\u2019ve secured the perimeter but I don\u2019t think we should hold it for too much longer.\nTony: [Looks over top of glasses. Sees Natalie.] You\u2019re fired.\nNatalie: That\u2019s not up to you. [Sits down next to Fury]\nFury: Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.\nTony: Hi.\nNatalie/Agent Romanoff: I\u2019m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.\nTony: I suggest you apologise.\nFury: You\u2019ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you\u2019re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn\u2019t know better\u2026\nTony: You don\u2019t know better. I didn\u2019t give it to him. He took it.\nFury: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You\u2019re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Agent Romanoff] Is that possible?\nAgent Romanoff: Well, according to Mr Stark\u2019s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.\nTony: What do you want from me?\nFury: What do we want from you? What do you want from me? [Agent Romanoff leaves] You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. [Romanoff returns with an injection] Hit him.\nTony: Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? [Rash goes down] Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?\nFury: What did we just do for you? That\u2019s lithium dioxide. It\u2019s gonna take the edge off. We\u2019re trying to get you back to work.\nTony: Give me a couple of boxes of that. I\u2019ll be right as rain.\nAgent Romanoff: It\u2019s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.\nFury: Doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s gonna be an easy fix.\nTony: Trust me, I know. I\u2019m good at this stuff. I\u2019ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I\u2019ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.\nFury: Well, I\u2019m here to tell you, you haven\u2019t tried them all.\n[Scene change. Hammer Industries]\nJustin: Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram. [Ivan climbs down from where he was working] I brought you something. Oh yeah. [Removes cloth] We got you the bird, pal.\nIvan: This is not my bird.\nJustin: What do you mean? That\u2019s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird.\nJack: It\u2019s a beautiful bird.\nJustin: We got this bird all the way from Russia.\nIvan: Hey, man, this is not my bird.\nJustin: Well, listen, even if it\u2019s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don\u2019t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that\u2026 That\u2019s not a helmet. What is that? [Walks up to suit] Ivan\u2026 What\u2019s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn\u2019t look like a helmet to me. How\u2026 How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?\nJack: No.\nJustin: Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there. [Jack put it on his head] See, Ivan? He can\u2019t put his head in there. That\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s not a helmet. It\u2019s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?\nIvan: Drone better.\nJustin: What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?\nIvan: People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.\nJustin: Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, \u201cNo problem.\u201d That\u2019s what you said to me. You said, \u201cNo problem.\u201d Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That\u2019s what the people want. That\u2019s what\u2019s gonna make them happy.\nIvan: Hey, man. Don\u2019t get too attached to things. Learn to let go.\nJustin: These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.\n[Scene change. Air base]\nGeneral: Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It\u2019s functional?\nRhodey: Fully mission-capable.\nGeneral: Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.\nRhodey: Sir?\nGeneral: Justin Hammer\u2019s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We\u2019d like this to introduce it.\nRhodey: Sir, I don\u2019t believe that the Expo\u2026\nGeneral: Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We\u2019ve got to make this happen.\nRhodey: Yes, General, but\u2026\nGeneral: It\u2019s also an order.\nRhodey: Yes sir.\nGeneral: Good work, Colonel. You\u2019ve made your country proud.\nRhodey: Thank you sir.\n[Scene change. Tony\u2019s house. It\u2019s a bit broken. He is sitting with Nick Fury.]\nFury: That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.\nTony: No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my\u2026\nFury: No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.\nTony: Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?\nFury: Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn\u2019t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.\nTony: You told me I hadn\u2019t tried everything. What do you mean I haven\u2019t tried everything? What haven\u2019t I tried?\nFury: He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.\nTony: He said that?\nFury: Are you that guy? Are you? \u2018Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.\nTony: I don\u2019t know where you get your information, but he wasn\u2019t my biggest fan.\nFury: What do you remember about your dad?\nTony: He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it\u2019s a little tough for me to digest when you\u2019re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he\u2019s passing it down. I don\u2019t get that. You\u2019re talking about a guy who\u2019s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.\nFury: That\u2019s not true.\nTony: Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.\nFury: As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.\nTony: What?\nFury: I got a two o\u2019clock\nTony: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What\u2019s this?\nFury: Okay, you\u2019re good, right?\nTony: No, I\u2019m not good.\nFury: You got this? Right? Right?\nTony: Got what? I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m supposed to get.\nFury: Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?\nTony: Yeah.\nFury: And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. [Fury leaves]\nNatalie/Agent Romanoff/Natasha (We\u2019ll stick with Natasha from now on): We\u2019ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck. [She leaves]\nTony: [Turning to Agent Coulson] Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I\u2019ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that\u2019d be nice.\nAgent Coulson: I\u2019m not here for that. I\u2019ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?\nTony: I think I got it, yeah.\nAgent Coulson: Enjoy your evening\u2019s entertainment. [Leaves. Tony looks at the box that has been left for him.]\n[Scene change. Air base. Dismantling the suit]\nMajor Allen: Think this is the power source?\nRhodey: Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let\u2019s just focus on arming it, all right?\nMajor Allen: Yes, sir.\nJustin: [Entering. Sucking on a red lollipop.] Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?\nRhodey: Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you\u2019re gonna do for us.\nJustin: What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I\u2019m gonna do for you is I\u2019m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should\u2026\nRhodey: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. I\u2019m talking about firepower.\nJustin: Well, you\u2019re talking to the right guy. [Bites lollipop. Time jump. Kind of. He now has weapons to show to Rhodey.] Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You\u2019re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I\u2019m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It\u2019s beautiful, But I can tell this isn\u2019t disco enough for you, so I\u2019m gonna put it right here. You\u2019re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You\u2019re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine DX burst. It\u2019s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff\u2019s Third. My Pieta. It\u2019s completely elegant. It\u2019s bafflingly beautiful. And it\u2019s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That\u2019s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You\u2019re like a sphinx. I can\u2019t read you.\nRhodey: I think I\u2019ll take it.\nJustin: Which one?\nRhodey: All of it.\nJustin: All of it.\n[Scene change. Tony is looking through the box. Blue prints for the arc reactor. Newspaper articles. Video reels.]\nHoward (on video): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath, [Tony is flicking through a notebook as the video plays] and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. I\u2019m Howard Stark, and everything you\u2019ll need for the future can be found right here. City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of\u2026 I\u2019m Howard Stark and everything you\u2019ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally\u2026 Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that? [Little Tony has picked one of the buildings up off the model.] Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where\u2019s your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go. [A man takes little Tony off, presumably to where his mother is]\nMan (out of sight): All right, I think we got\u2026\nHoward: I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll\u2026 I\u2019ll come in and\u2026 [Video changes]\nMan: Are you waiting on me? [Howard drinks. Looks like whiskey. Video changes again]\nHoward: So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I\u2019d like to personally show you my ass. I\u2019d like to\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 This is\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 We have this, don\u2019t we? This is a ridiculous way\u2026 Everything [Tony reaches end of notebook. Blank pages. Probably ones his father never got to fill in as he died] is achievable through technology. [Tony throws the book to one side and drinks] Tony. You\u2019re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you\u2019ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people\u2019s inventions. It represents my life\u2019s work. This is the key to the future. I\u2019m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you\u2019ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he\u2019s about to cry as the film ends.\nScene change. He\u2019s driving down a road in car number plate Stark11\nHe stops to but some strawberries.]\nTony [Spanish]: How much?\nStrawberry man: $6. Six.\nTony: I don\u2019t have any dough. Here. [Takes off watch]\nStrawberry man: No, sir, that\u2019s too much.\nTony: No, it\u2019s fine. Take that. It\u2019s fine\nStrawberry man: No, se\u00f1or.\nTony: Take it. Take it. I don\u2019t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that\u2019d be great.\nStrawberry man: Are you Iron Man?\nTony: Sometimes.\nStrawberry man: [As Tony drives off] We believe in you!\n[Now in Pepper\u2019s office]\nPepper: It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.\nPA: Miss Potts?\nTony: Relax.\nPA: Mr Stark\u2026\nTony: Is here.\nPA: He refuses\u2026\nTony: I don\u2019t. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just be a second.\nPepper (on phone): Listen, it\u2019s our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform.\nNews reporter (on telly): When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America.\nPepper: No, the suit belongs to us.\nNews reporter: We trusted that he would look out for us.\nPepper: Yeah, but you\u2019re not\u2026\nNews reporter: He obviously did not.\nPepper: Burt\u2026\nNews reporter: And now we learn that his secretary\u2026\nPepper: Yes, it does.\nNews reporter: \u2026a woman named Virginia \u201cPepper\u201d Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?\nPepper: No.\nNews reporter: Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible\u2026\nTony: Mute.\nPepper: No\u2026 Burt\u2026 Burt\u2026 Burt, listen to me. Don\u2019t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.\nTony: [Looking at boxes and things in the corner.] I\u2019ll get this stuff out of here.\nPepper: Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We\u2019ll talk about it at the Expo. [Tony pulls back a sheet and finds the same model as that that was in the video with his father] Hammer\u2019s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?\nTony: [Pulling up a chair] Will I?\nPepper: No, he will not. Bye.\nTony: I would like to be. Got a minute?\nPepper: No.\nTony: Come on, you just got off the phone. You\u2019re fine. 30 seconds.\nPepper: Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.\nTony: I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I\u2019m not.\nPepper: You didn\u2019t come here to apologise?\nTony: Look, that goes without saying, and I\u2019m working on that. But I haven\u2019t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It\u2019s like a Ferris wheel, going. I\u2019m trying to get some\u2026\nPepper: No.\nTony: Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express\u2026 And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don\u2019t care\u2026 I mean, I care. It would be nice. I\u2019m not expecting you to\u2026 Look, here\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say. I\u2019m just gonna say it.\nPepper: Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say \u201cI\u201d one more time, I\u2019m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?\nTony: Yes.\nPepper: People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you\u2019ve disappeared, and all I\u2019m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there\u2019s only one thing on Earth that I\u2019m allergic to?\nTony: Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.\nPepper: I need you\u2026\nTony: I need you too.\nPepper: \u2026to leave now\nTony: That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to\u2026\nNatasha: [Entering as Natalie in front of Happy] Ms Potts?\nPepper: Hi, come on in.\nNatasha: Wheels up in 25 minutes.\nPepper: Thank you.\nHappy: Anything else, boss?\nTony: I\u2019m good, Hap.\nPepper: No, I\u2019ll be just another minute.\nTony: I lost both the kids in the divorce. [Tony looks over to Happy, who shakes his head.] Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn\u2019t it? I thought you two didn\u2019t get along?\nPepper: No. That\u2019s not so.\nTony: It\u2019s just me you don\u2019t care for. No? Nothing?\nPepper: Actually, while you\u2019re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.\nNatasha: Absolutely. [Pepper and Happy leave] I\u2019m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.\nTony: Boy, you\u2019re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things\u2026 You\u2019re a triple imposter. I\u2019ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?\nNatasha: [Latin]\nTony: Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?\nNatasha: It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. [She leaves.]\nTony: You\u2019re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.\nScene change. Driving it home, fading into workshop]\nTony: Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.\nJarvis: 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.\nTony: [Lifting the blue projection away from the model] How many buildings are there?\nJarvis: Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?\nTony: That was rhetorical. Just show me. [Clicks his fingers and the model begins to spin and lifts upright] What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.\nJarvis: What is it you\u2019re trying to achieve, sir?\nTony: I\u2019m discovering\u2026 Correction. I\u2019m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. [Tony flicks things away] Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. [The model now resembles a nucleus and Tony expands it.] Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. [Tony snaps down so the model fits in his hand]\nJarvis: The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.\nTony: Thank Dad.\nJarvis: Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.\nTony: Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We\u2019re back in hardware mode.\n[Smashing walls with sledge hammers, drilling holes in the floor, fiddling with wires, putting together pipes.\nAgent Coulson enters]\nAgent Coulson: I heard you broke the perimeter.\nTony: Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?\nAgent Coulson: I was doing some stuff.\nTony: Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I\u2019m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?\nAgent Coulson: [Pulls a familiar looking object out of a box] What\u2019s this doing here?\nTony: That\u2019s it. Bring that to me.\nAgent Coulson: You know what this is?\nTony: [As Agent Coulson hands it to him] It\u2019s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And\u2026 Drop it. Drop it. [The shield is now in position and the coil straight.] Perfectly level. I\u2019m busy. What do you want?\nAgent Coulson: Nothing. Goodbye. I\u2019ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.\nTony: Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.\nAgent Coulson: So I\u2019m told.\nTony: Secret stuff?\nAgent Coulson: Something like that. Good luck.\nTony: Bye. Thanks. [They shake hands]\nAgent Coulson: We need you.\nTony: Yeah, more than you know.\nAgent Coulson: Not that much. [He leaves. Tony goes back to building.]\nJarvis: Initialising prismatic accelerator. [Tony turns a wheel on top] Approaching maximum power. [Using a wrench as a lever, the wheel is turned, but not before cutting holes in the wall. Eventually it\u2019s concentrated on a triangle which begins to glow blue.]\nTony: That was easy. [He removes the triangle using a pair of pliers]\nJarvis: Congratulations sir. You have created a new element. [Placed into arc reactor] Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.\n[Scene change. Ivan is also building an arc reactor]\nJustin (on phone from golf course): Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we\u2019d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.\nIvan: The drone is not going to be ready.\nJustin: Not ready? What do you mean?\nIvan: I can make presentation, not demonstration.\nJustin: What the hell is the difference?\nIvan: Presentation. No fly. No shoot.\nJustin: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.\nIvan: I can make salute.\nJustin: You can make salute? What do you mean \u201cmake salute\u201d? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones. [Camera pans to show Ivan has remade his arc reactor whips]\nIvan: Hey, man, everything will be okay.\nJustin: This is not what I wanted.\n[Justin is back at Hammer Industries. Enters Ivan\u2019s room with two men.]\nJustin: Hey, there he is. It\u2019s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I\u2019m confused. You said it wasn\u2019t, but now it looks like you\u2019re the best of pals. You love that bird, don\u2019t you? You know what? Take the bird.\nIvan: [As man grabs bird] Hey!\nJustin: Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. \u2018Cause that\u2019s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re a genius or a fraud. I don\u2019t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn\u2019t, I\u2019d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I\u2019m getting at here?\nIvan: [Russian]\nJustin: I don\u2019t know if you know this, but I don\u2019t speak Russian! I\u2019m gonna leave now. I\u2019m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I\u2019ll even get laid. You see these guys? They\u2019re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we\u2019re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you\u2019re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves]\n[Tony\u2019s house]\nTony: Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You\u2019re killing me. You know I don\u2019t\u2026\nJarvis: Incoming call with a blocked number sir.\nTony: My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How\u2019s the Land of Enchantment?\nIvan: Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.\nTony: You what?\nIvan: You told me double cycle\u2019s more power. Good advice.\nTony: You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.\nIvan: You too.\nTony: [mutes his speaker] Trace him.\nJarvis: Sir.\nIvan: Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.\nTony: Jarvis, where is he?\nJarvis: Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.\nIvan: What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.\nTony: Sounds good. Let\u2019s get together and hash it out.\nJarvis: Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.\nIvan: I hope you\u2019re ready. [Call ends]\nJarvis: Call trace incomplete.\n[Sees advert for Justin\u2019s presentation. Picks up new arc reactor]\nJarvis: Sir\nTony: You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you\u2019re at it. Put it together now.\nJarvis: We are unclear as to the effects.\nTony: I don\u2019t want to hear it Jarvis. [Reactor gains power] That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!\n[Stark Expo\nNatasha opens the door for Pepper to exit the car]\nHappy: I\u2019ll keep the car down here, all right?\nPepper: Thank you Happy.\nAnnouncer: \u2026Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.\n[Begins. Justin dances on to the stage]\nJustin: Yeah. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm\u2019s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s not right. And it\u2019s just too bad.\nPepper: Oh, Lord.\nJustin: Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink. [Two people run on to remove the podium] Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone. [Drones rise out of the stage as he calls names] Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That\u2019s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war [Ivan is typing something] Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.\nPepper: What? [Rises and salutes.]\nJustin: For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for\u2026 [incoming Iron Man]\nTony: We got trouble.\nRhodey: Tony, there are civilians present. I\u2019m here on orders. Let\u2019s not do this right now.\nTony: Give them a wave.\nJustin: Hey, all right. Yeah.\nTony: All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.\nRhodey: Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?\nTony: Listen, I think he\u2019s working with Vanko.\nRhodey: Vanko\u2019s alive?\nJustin: Yeah. [Tony approaches him]\nTony: What is he?\nJustin: What?\nTony: Where\u2019s Vanko?\nJustin: Who?\nTony: Tell me.\nJustin: What are you doing here man?\nRhodey: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\nTony: [As a large gun takes aim] Is that you?\nRhodey: No, I\u2019m not doing that. That\u2019s not me. I can\u2019t move. I\u2019m locked up. I\u2019m locked up! [Drones take aim] Get out of here. Go! This whole system\u2019s been compromised.\nTony: [Takes off] Let\u2019s take it outside. [Drones and Rhodey fire at him. Rhodey takes off]\nRhodey: No, no!\nTony: Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.\nJarvis: Yes sir.\nRhodey: Tony, Tony, I\u2019m locked on. I have target lock.\nTony: On what?\nRhodey: On you. [Shooting at Tony] Tony, on your six!\nJustin: [Running to a computer] What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening?\nTechnician: The software\u2019s been overridden.\nJustin: What? What do you mean it\u2019s been overridden? What does that mean?\nTechnician: I think he slaved the drones.\nJustin: That\u2019s impossible. Call the guards.\nJack: All the phones are down sir.\nJustin: Well, then call their\u2026 Call their cells.\nJack: Their cell phones are not working either sir.\nTechnician: He\u2019s locked us out of the mainframe.\nPepper: [Entering] Who\u2019s locked you out of the mainframe?\nJustin: Please, please, go away. Go away. I\u2019ve got this handled.\nPepper: Have you now?\nJustin: Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn\u2019t showed up, this wouldn\u2019t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you [To technician] Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?\nNatasha: [Grabs Justin and holds him down on the desk] You tell me who\u2019s behind this. Who\u2019s behind this?\nJustin: Ivan. Ivan Vanko.\nNatasha: Where is he?\nJustin: At my facility. \n[Natasha lets go and leaves. Pepper dials a number on her phone]\nPepper: I need NYPD, please.\nJustin: No, no, no!\nPepper: Command Central.\nJustin: No, no, honey. Don\u2019t call the authorities.\nPepper: Okay. Right away. Right away. [To Justin] Step aside. Step aside. [To technician] Tell me everything you know. Go.\n[Tony is still being chased by Rhodey\u2019s suit and the air force drones]\nTony: How are we doing Jarvis?\nJarvis: Remote reboot unsuccessful.\n[Other drones are now firing at the running crowds. Natasha leaves the building.]\nSecurity guard: This way.\nHappy: Nobody\u2019s answering the phone. What\u2019s going on?\nNatasha: Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.\nHappy: I\u2019m not taking you anywhere.\nNatasha: Fine. You want me to drive?\nHappy: No, I\u2019m driving. Get in the car.\n[Lots of shooting drones and people screaming. The kid with the Iron Man helmet is targeted by a drone and holds his hand up. Tony lands behind him and shoots the drone with his hand repulsor]\nTony: Nice work kid. [Takes off again]\nRhodey: You got multiples coming in on you.\nTony: Let\u2019s get this away from the Expo.\n[Inside car]\nNatasha: Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter. [She\u2019s getting undressed in the back of the car] I\u2019m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.\nHappy: I got it. I got it.\n[Tony and Rhodey. Tony sets off one car alarm, the drones set off the rest.\nIvan is still typing inside Hammer Industries]\nRhodey: Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They\u2019re headed back to the Expo.\nTony: Got it.\nRhodey: In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.\n[Hammer Industries. Happy parks the car outside. More of less]\nNatasha: Stay in the car.\nHappy: I\u2019m not staying in the car.\nNatasha: I said, stay in the car.\nHappy: [As Natasha heads up the stairs to the front door] What are you wearing? Look, I\u2019m not letting you go in there alone.\nNatasha: You want to help? Keep the car running.\nHappy: [Opens the door as she unlocks it and runs in] Okay.\n[Ivan gets a security breach message]\nHammer security guard: Hey, hey, hey. You can\u2019t come in here.\n[Happy punches him and Natasha heads past.]\nSecond guard: Hold on. Hey!\n[Natasha fights the other guards. Some using her SHIELD tech, some just kicking or punching them.\nBack at Expo]\nTechnician: Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.\nPepper: Well, choose one and focus on that.\nJustin: Have you tried Russian? Why don\u2019t you try Russian?\n[Hammer Industries. Happy is still fighting the same guard.]\nAnnouncement: Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.\nSecurity guard: We got it. We\u2019re on our way.\n[And Natasha throws something. And takes on like five guards at once. She walks away, casually spraying one with pepper spray. All this while Happy\u2019s fighting one guy. Happy wins.]\nHappy: I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done\nIvan gets up.\nTony is trying to let the drones away]\nTony: Rhodey, you still locked on?\nRhodey: Yeah.\nTony: Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We\u2019re about to get wet on this ride.\nRhodey: Wait, wait, wait!\n[Tony leads the drones through the globe sculpture. Most explode hitting parts of it.\nNatasha kicks open Ivan\u2019s door, a gun in each hand. Happy is behind her. The room is empty.]\nNatasha: He\u2019s gone.\n[Tony and Rhodey]\nTony: I\u2019m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What\u2019s your 20?\n[Directly above him. Both crash into biodome\nNatasha puts her guns on the table and starts typing.]\nHappy: What are you doing?\nNatasha: I\u2019m rebooting Rhodey\u2019s suit.\n[Rhodey is on top of Tony, who is pushing the gun to keep it from shooting him]\nRhodey: Tony.\n[Natasha gains access.\nRhodey\u2019s suit shuts down]\nNatasha: Reboot complete [Image of Tony on screen] You got your best friend back.\nTony: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.\nNatasha: Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.\nTony: Yes, for the moment, I\u2019m not dying. Thank you.\nPepper: [Image appears on second screen] What do you mean you\u2019re not dying? Did you just say you\u2019re dying?\nTony: Is that you? No, I\u2019m not. Not anymore. [Natasha looks confused.]\nPepper: What\u2019s going on?\nTony: I was going to tell you. I didn\u2019t want to alarm you.\nPepper: You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?\nTony: You didn\u2019t let me.\nPepper: Why didn\u2019t you tell me that?\nTony: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.\nNatasha: Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight\u2019s coming to you.\nTony: Great. Pepper?\nPepper: Are you okay now?\nTony: I am fine. Don\u2019t be mad. I will formally apologise\u2026\nPepper: I am mad!\nTony: \u2026when I\u2019m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.\nPepper: Fine.\nTony: We could have been in Venice.\nPepper: Oh please.\n[Tony taps Rhodey\u2019s helmet as the system restarts.]\nTony: Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They\u2019re coming. Come on, let\u2019s roll. Get up.\nRhodey: [Helmet opens] Oh, man. You can have your suit back.\nTony: [Helps him up] You okay?\nRhodey: Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I\u2019m sorry, okay?\nTony: Don\u2019t be.\nRhodey: No. I should have trusted you more.\nTony: I\u2019m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.\nRhodey: No. It\u2019s your fault. I just wanted to say I\u2019m sorry.\nTony: Thank you. That\u2019s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They\u2019re coming in hot, any second. What\u2019s the play?\nRhodey: Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let\u2019s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.\nTony: Got you. Where do you want to be?\nRhodey: Where are you going?\nTony: What\u2019re you talking about?\nRhodey: I meant me.\nTony: You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.\nRhodey: Tony, don\u2019t be jealous.\nTony: No. It\u2019s subtle all the bells and whistles.\nRhodey: Yeah. It\u2019s called being a badass.\nTony: Fine. All right. You go up to. I\u2019ll draw them in.\nRhodey: Don\u2019t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.\nTony: Okay, you got a spot. Where\u2019s mine?\nRhodey: It\u2019s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. [Drones incoming. And Rhodey and Ton are still in the kill box. Helmets down. Shooting begins.]\nTony: See that?\nRhodey: Yeah, yeah. Nice.\nTony: Rhodey? Get down. [Laser slices all the drones in half. And a tree.] \nRhodey: Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.\nTony: Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It\u2019s a one-off.\n[Back inside Expo]\nJustin: I told you that five minutes ago.\nPepper: [As police enter] That\u2019s your guy here.\nJustin: Excuse me?\nPolice officer: You\u2019re being placed under arrest.\nJustin: Are you kidding me?\nPolice officer: Hands behind your back sir.\nJustin: I\u2019m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re trying to pin this on me, huh? That\u2019s good. That\u2019s good. You\u2019re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you\u2019re making a problem for me? [Being led away] I\u2019m gonna make a problem for you. I\u2019m gonna be seeing you again real soon.\nPepper: [Now outside with some police officers] When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.\nPolice officer: We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.\nPepper: Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.\nPolice officer: Yeah. Are you coming with us?\nPepper: No, I\u2019m gonna stay until to park is clear.\nPolice officer: Okay.\n[Hammer Industries]\nNatasha: Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. [Tony and Rhodey; Natasha on speaker] The repulsor signature is significantly higher.\nIvan: [Landing in a full suit] Good to be back.\nRhodey: This ain\u2019t gonna be good. [Ivan\u2019s whisps turn on] I got something special for this guy. I\u2019m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.\nTony: With the what? [Rhodey shoots it and it bounces off Ivan, fizzling off in the water] Hammer tech?\nRhodey: Yeah.\nTony: I got this. [Targets points on Ivan\u2019s armour. Doesn\u2019t do much. Both shooting, fighting. Ends with both Tony and Rhodey held onto by Ivan\u2019s whips] Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?\nRhodey: What?\nTony: I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.\nRhodey: This is your idea?\nTony: Yep.\nRhodey: I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m ready. Go, go, go!\nTony: Take it! [Same as at the house, they shoot each other and the middle explodes. Unfortunately for Ivan, he is in the middle]\nIvan: You lose. [Dies. Reactor starts flashing red. So do all the drones]\nRhodey: All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.\nTony: Pepper? [Takes off. Pepper is by a drone. Tony grabs her just as it explodes. They land on a roof. Takes off helmet.]\nPepper: Oh my God. I can\u2019t take this anymore.\nTony: You can\u2019t?\nPepper: I can\u2019t take this.\nTony: Look at me.\nPepper: My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you\u2019re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.\nTony: I think I did okay. [Everything being on fire having been covered by exploding drones behind him. One more explosion. Just as he finishes speaking.]\nPepper: I quit. I\u2019m resigning. That\u2019s it.\nTony: What did you just say? You\u2019re done? That\u2019s surprising. No, it\u2019s not surprising. I get it. You don\u2019t have to make excuses.\nPepper: I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not making any excuses.\nTony: You actually were just making excuses. But you don\u2019t have to.\nPepper: No, I wasn\u2019t making an excuse. I\u2019m actually very justified.\nTony: Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.\nPepper: Well\u2026\nTony: You\u2019ve taken such good care of me. I\u2019ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so\u2026 Right?\nPepper: Thank you.\nTony: Yeah.\nPepper: Thank you for understanding.\nTony: Yeah, yeah. Let\u2019s talk clean-up.\nPepper: I\u2019ll handle the transition. It\u2019ll be smooth.\nTony: Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That\u2019s gonna seem\u2026\nPepper: Well, with you it\u2019s like dog years.\nTony: I know.\nPepper: I mean, it\u2019s like the Presidency. [They kiss]\nTony: Weird.\nPepper: No, it\u2019s not weird.\nTony: It\u2019s okay, right?\nPepper: Yeah.\nTony: Run that by me again. [They start to kiss again]\nRhodey: I think it was weird. [They break apart and turn around] You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.\nPepper: I had just quit, actually.\nTony: Yeah, so we\u2019re not\u2026\nRhodey: You don\u2019t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.\nTony: You should get lost.\nRhodey: I was here first. Get a roof.\nTony: I thought you were out of one-liners.\nRhodey: That\u2019s the last one.\nTony: You kicked ass back there, by the way.\nRhodey: Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I\u2019m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?\nTony: Not okay. Not okay with that.\nRhodey: It wasn\u2019t a question. [Takes off]\nTony: How are you gonna resign if I don\u2019t accept?\n[Scene change. Some kind of building. Tony is inside sitting at a table. SHIELD logo is there.\nPicks up file. AVENGERS INITIATIVE PREMLIMIARY REPORT\nNick Fury enters while looking and stops him opening it]\nFury: I don\u2019t think I want you looking at that. I\u2019m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff\u2019s assessment of you. Read it. [Hands Tony the file]\nTony: \u201cPersonality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.\u201d In my own defence, that was last week. \u201cProne to self-destructive tendencies.\u201d I was dying. I mean, please. Aren\u2019t we all? \u201cTextbook narcissism\u201d? Agreed. Okay, here it is. \u201cRecruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.\u201d I gotta think about it.\nFury: Read on.\nTony: \u201cTony Stark not\u2026 Not recommended\u201d? That doesn\u2019t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I\u2019m trying to do right by Pepper. I\u2019m in a stable-ish relationship. [Fury walks round and rest against the table by Tony\u2019s chair]\nFury: Which leads us to believe at this juncture we\u2019d only like to use you as a consultant. [Tony stands and offers his hand. They shake]\nTony: [Clasping his other hand on top of Fury\u2019s] You can\u2019t afford me. [Goes to leave, but turns around again] Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.\nFury: I\u2019ll see what I can do.\n[Scene change. Washington. ACDC\u2019s Highway To Hell Starts to play]\nStern: It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure. [Pinning on medals] Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.\nRhodey: Thank you sir.\nStern: Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this. [Tony winces in pain] Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s get a photo.\n\n\n[Pose for a photo. Roll credits. Cue end credits scene. A car rolls up. Well-dressed shoes. Agent Coulson looks down on a crater. Takes off sunglasses and pulls out phone]\nAgent Coulson: Sir, we\u2019ve found it.\n[Camera pans out and there seems to be a hammer. The End.]\n\n\n\n\n"

        "text": "Odin: [voice over] Long before the birth of light there was darkness, and from that darkness, came the Dark Elves. Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith, sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.\n[Malekith is looking up at the Convergence]\nOdin: Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether, an ancient force of infinite destruction.\n[the Aether is shown]\nOdin: The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor, waged a mighty war against these creatures.\n[the Dark Elves and Asgardians are shown fighting]\n[Kurse walks up to Malekith]\nKurse: [subtitled] Malekith! Asgard's forces are upon us.\n[the Bifrost opens, and bor steps out with Asgardian reinforcements]\nMalekith: Send the Kursed.\n[some soldiers crush objects in their hands and become giant hulk-like creatures]\n[Malekith looks up at the Convergence again]\nOdin: As the Nine Worlds converged above him, Malekith could at last unleash the Aether...\n[Malekith and Kurse walk up to the Aether]\n[however, the Bifrost opens and Asgardian warriors attack Malekith, whom he kills]\n[the Bifrost disappears, just as Malekith tries to get the Aether, but it is no longer there]\nOdin: But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp. Without it, the Dark Elves fell. With the battle all but lost, Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.\n[Malekith watches as his forces are slaughtered]\nMalekith: [subtitled] Their deaths will mean our survival. This war is far from over.\n[he and Kurse get onto his ship and escape without notice, while destroying the other ships in the process]\n[the ships kill some of the Asgardians]\nOdin: Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more. Or so we were led to believe.\nAsgardian Einherjar: Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?\nBor: If only we could. But its power is too great. Bury it deep. Somewhere no one will ever find it.\n\n[Asgard \u2013 Throne Room. Loki, in chains, is brought to Odin.]\nFrigga: Loki.\nLoki: Hello, mother. Have I made you proud?\nFrigga: Please, don't make this worse.\nLoki: Define worse.\nOdin: Enough! I will speak to the prisoner alone.\n[Frigga leaves.]\nLoki: [laughs] I really don't see what all the fuss is about.\nOdin: Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.\nLoki: I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god. Just like you.\nOdin: We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die. Just as humans do.\nLoki: Give or take 5000 years.\nOdin: All this because Loki desires a throne.\nLoki: It is my birthright.\nOdin: Your birthright was to die as a child. Cast out onto a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me.\nLoki: If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't love our little talks, it's just ... I don't love them.\nOdin: Frigga is the only reason you are still alive and you will never see her again. You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.\nLoki: And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?\nOdin: Thor must strife to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the nine realms and then, yes. He will be king.\n\n\n[Cut to Vanaheim]\n[Sif, the Warriors Three and Thor are fighting in a battle.]\nSif: I've got this completely under control!\nThor: Is that why everything is on fire?\n[Sif catches an arrow that was aimed at Thor with her shield.]\nSif: You're welcome. [a Kronan arrives] All yours.\nThor: Hello. [the Kronan growls] I accept your surrender.\n[The soldiers laugh. Thor swings his hammer and crushes the Kronan.]\nThor: Anyone else?\n[The soldiers surrender.]\nFandral: Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.\nGuard: Keep moving. Come on! Keep moving. Go ahead of me. Don't you turn around!\nHogun: Where do we go next?\nThor: Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms. You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is. Asgard can wait.\nHogun: You have my thanks.\nThor: As you have mine. Heimdall, when you're ready.\n\n\n[Cut to Asgard]\nOdin: Is Vanaheim secure?\nThor: As are Nornheim and Ria. Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.\nOdin: You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.\nThor: That was not my intent.\nOdin: For the first time since the Bifrost was destroyed, the Nine Realms are at peace. They're well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.\nThor: Thank you.\nOdin: Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.\nThor: This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.\nOdin: Human lives are fleeting, they are nothing. You'd be better served by what lies in front of you [Camera briefly turns to Sif] I'm telling you this not as the all-father but as your father. You are ready. The time has come for you to take the throne. Embrace and celebrate what you've won. Join your warriors. Eat and drink, revel in their celebration. At least pretend to enjoy yourself.\n[and as they celebrate, as he watches the others enjoying themselves it's obvious his heart is not in it, he walks over to the balcony to join Sif]\nSif: There was a time you would celebrate for weeks.\nThor: I remember you celebrated the battle of Haragon so much that you nearly started a second.\nSif: Well, the first was so much fun.\n[they both smile]\nSif: Take a drink with me. Surely the All-Father could have no further task for you tonight.\nThor: No, this is one I set myself.\nSif: It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night. There are Nine Realms. Future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.\nThor: I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.\n[he turns and walks off]\n[in London Jane is on a date with a man named Richard, Jane is looking at her menu feeling awkward when Richard slides a napkin in front of her with the word 'Hi' written on it]\nRichard: Hi.\nJane Foster: Hi.\nRichard: So what's the story with you?\nJane Foster: Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.\nRichard: You've spent the first ten minutes of our date hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it. It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane. I think there's a story and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?\nJane Foster: It's complicated.\nRichard: Is he still around?\nJane Foster: No, he...went away.\nRichard: I've been there. The going away, it's hard. I'd been seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York, eventually the distance killed it. And...and the fact that she uh...she kept sleeping with other dudes.\nJane Foster: No!\nRichard: Oh, so many.\n[Darcy walks up to Jane and Richard's table]\nRichard: Hi. Um...could we get some wine please?\nDarcy Lewis: Sure, I'd love some.\nJane Foster: Richard, this is Darcy. [to Darcy] What are you doing here?\n[Darcy grabs a chair from the opposite table and drags it across to their table]\nRichard: Oh, hello.\n[Darcy sits next to Jane and helps herself to a piece of bread and starts buttering it]\nDarcy Lewis: So, I show up to work at the lab-slash-your mom's house, fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas eating ice cream obsessing about you know who...\nRichard: Ah.\nDarcy Lewis: But you're not! You're wearing lady clothes, you even showered, didn't you? You smell good.\nJane Foster: Is there a point to all this, cause there really has to be a point to all this.\nDarcy Lewis: Right. You know that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore? You might wanna start looking at it now\n[she gives Jane the gadget]\nDarcy Lewis: This is the reason we came all the way out here.\nJane Foster: It's malfunctioning.\nDarcy Lewis: That's what I said.\n[Jane starts hitting the gadget on the table]\nDarcy Lewis: That's what I did! But you just hit a little more scientific.\nJane Foster: I'm sure it's nothing.\nRichard: Yeah.\n[Jane hands the gadget back to Darcy]\nDarcy Lewis: It didn't look like nothing. Kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about. [to Richard] Our friend Erik, kind of went banana-balls.\nJane Foster: He's not interested. I'm not interested. Time for you to go now.\nDarcy Lewis: Okay.\n[Jane rises and drags her chair back to where she got it from, then turns and walks off]\nRichard: Short but sweet.\nJane Foster: She needs help.\n[they start looking at their menus again, but Jane looks distracted by what Darcy told her]\nRichard: I think I'm gonna have the sea bass.\nJane Foster: Sea bass. Yeah, sea bass is good.\n[to herself as she thinks about what Darcy showed her]\nJane Foster: Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass...sea bass. Sea bass...\nRichard: Jane, maybe you should stop saying sea bass and go out to your friend.\n[Jane looks at him awkwardly]\nJane Foster: This was so fun.\nRichard: You know, I'll just stay here and say sea bass alone.\n[Jane enters Darcy's car parked outside the restaurant]\nJane Foster: And I hate you.\nDarcy Lewis: What?! I thought he was cute.\nJane Foster: Just shut up and drive.\n[Darcy pulls out and drive off, as they are driving through London suddenly Jane's is shocked to see a guy sat in the back seat]\nJane Foster: Who's he?\nDarcy Lewis: He's my intern.\nJane Foster: You have an intern?\nDarcy Lewis: Oh, yeah.\nIan Boothby: Hello, Dr. Foster. It's uh...it's a great honor to be working with you.\nJane Foster: Right. I have to call Erik.\n[to Darcy as he checks the navigator]\nIan Boothby: Oh, uh...take a right.\n[Darcy quickly makes a sharp turn]\nIan Boothby: Left!\n[she then turns quickly left]\nDarcy Lewis: I have totally mastered driving in London.\n[Jane calls Erik and leaves a message]\nJane Foster: Hi, Erik, it's me again. Where are you? I came here because you said you were onto something and then vanished.\n[a news report is then shown where Selvig is naked and running around Stonehenge while the police try to catch him]\nStonehenge TV News Reporter: I'm here at Stonehenge, for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today. The police reported the scene shortly after 11 a.m. this morning, after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area then started to strip naked and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment while shouting that he was trying to save them. The man later identified as noted Astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig has been called in for questioning by police.\n[Darcy pulls up outside an old abandoned factory and they all get out of the car]\nDarcy Lewis: Come on, this is exciting! Look, the intern is excited.\nIan Boothby: Ian.\nDarcy Lewis: Do you want the phase meter?\nJane Foster: No.\nDarcy Lewis: [to Ian] Bring the phase meter.\n[she throws the car keys at Ian and starts walking off]\nDarcy Lewis: The toaster looking thing.\nIan Boothby: I know what the phase meter is.\n[as Jane walks towards the factory Darcy calls her on her cell phone which starts playing an annoying music tone]\nJane Foster: How do I change the ring tone on this thing?\nDarcy Lewis: An Astrophysicist with three degrees should be able to change her own ring tone.\n[Jane turns to look at Darcy]\nJane Foster: Why are you calling me?\nDarcy Lewis: I didn't want to shout. [to Ian, who's following behind her] Intern, the entrance is this way.\nIan Boothby: Ian. My name's Ian.\n[as they enter the old factory they hear a noise]\nDarcy Lewis: I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.\n[she holds up her hands and shouts]\nDarcy Lewis: It's okay, we're Americans!\nJane Foster: Is that supposed to make them like us?\n[suddenly the hear some kids voices]\nMaddie: Make it go away...\nNavid: Ssh!\n[three kids come out of their hiding place]\nJane Foster: Oh, they're kids.\nMaddie: Are you the police?\nJane Foster: No, we're scientists. Well, I am.\nDarcy Lewis: Thanks.\nNavid: We just found it.\nJane Foster: Can you show us?\n[the three kids lead Jane, Darcy and Ian to a truck, one of the boys touches the truck and pushes it up with two fingers, they watch in amazement as the truck floats in mid-air]\nDarcy Lewis: That doesn't seem rigged.\n[the kids then take them to a stairwell in the factory, one of them drops a bottle down and they watch as the bottle disappears into thin air]\nDarcy Lewis: Where did it go?\n[the girl points her finger up, they look up to see the bottle reappear above them and continuously fall and disappear in the same spots in the air]\nDarcy Lewis: That's...that's incredible.\n[Jane picks up an empty can and drops it down and it does the same thing, it disappears into thin air, but when they look up to watch it reappear nothing happens]\nDarcy Lewis: What happened?\nMaddie: Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.\nDarcy Lewis: I want to throw something. Jane, give me your shoe.\n[Jane picks up her gadget to look at the readings]\nJane Foster: I haven't seen readings like this since...\nDarcy Lewis: New Mexico?\n[Jane give Darcy a meaningful look before rushing off]\nJane Foster: Don't touch anything!\nDarcy Lewis: [to Ian] Give me your shoe.\n[Jane walks away from the others and watches them on the stairwell dropping objects down and watching them disappear and reappear, she sees looks at her gadget and sees the anomaly is nearby and starts walking off; back on the stairwell, Ian drops the car keys down and they watch it disappear but when they look up it doesn't reappear]\nDarcy Lewis: Where those the car keys?\n[Jane follows the readings on her gadget which takes her to another part of the factory, as the readings get stronger a gust of wind pushes her forward and she finds herself teleported in another realm]\nJane Foster: Darcy!\n[she looks around and finds the column holding the Aether, she reaches her hand out and suddenly the Aether enters her body and she passes out; at the same time we see Malekith being awakened in his ship, knowing that the Aether has been found]\nMalekith: [subtitled] The Aether awakens us. The Convergence returns.\n[back in Asgard, Thor walks up the bridge towards Heimdall]\nHeimdall: You're late.\nThor: Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.\nHeimdall: Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.\n[Thor chuckles]\nThor: Perhaps. How fare the stars?\nHeimdall: Still shining. From here I can see Nine Realms and ten trillion souls.\n[Heimdall looks at Thor for a moment]\nHeimdall: You recall what I told you of the Convergence?\nThor: Yes, the alignment of the worlds. It approaches, doesn't it?\nHeimdall: The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began. Few can sense, even fewer can see it. A world that's infected can be dangerous. It is truly beautiful.\n[they looks out into the stars]\nThor: I see nothing.\nHeimdall: Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.\n[Thor laughs]\nThor: How is she?\nHeimdall: She's quite clever, your mortal. She doesn't know it yet, but she studies the Convergence as well. Even...\n[Heimdall stops as he senses something]\nThor: What?\nHeimdall: I can't see her.\n[we see Jane being infected by the Aether] [after Jane is infected with the Aether she reawakens in the factory, she runs out to find Darcy has called the police]\nDarcy Lewis: Jane! Where the hell were you?\nJane Foster: Tell me you didn't call the police!\nDarcy Lewis: What was I supposed to do?\nJane Foster: Not call the police!\nDarcy Lewis: I was freaking out.\nJane Foster: You call the cops they tell the feds, the next thing you know we have SHIELD crawling all over area fifty-one-ing the place.\nDarcy Lewis: Jane!\nJane Foster: We had a stable gratification anomaly, we had unheeded access. Our only competition was ten years old!\nDarcy Lewis: Jane, you were gone for five hours!\nJane Foster: What? [suddenly the weather turns, it starts raining and they hear the sound of thunder, Jane looks around her and puts her hand out]\nDarcy Lewis: That's weird. [they see it's raining but it's not raining on Jane and Darcy, there's an invisible barrier protecting them, suddenly Jane sees Thor standing a few feet away from them, Jane hands her gadget to Darcy and walks towards Thor, as she walks away the invisible barrier follows her and the rain starts falling on Darcy] Typical. [as Jane walks towards Thor]\nThor: Jane. [as she reaches him suddenly she slaps him hard in the face]\nJane Foster: Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real, it's been a very strange day.\nThor: Well, I am. Jane... [suddenly she slaps him again]\nJane Foster: Where were you?!\nThor: Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.\nJane Foster: I was right here where you left me. I was waiting and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back\nThor: I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos, wars were raging, marauding hordes were pillaging. I had to put an end to the slaughter.\nJane Foster: As excuses go, that's not terrible. But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!\nThor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong, I was a fool. [Thor places his hand Jane's face] I believe that fate brought us together. Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened, but I do know this.\nJane Foster: What?\nThor: I know...\nJane Foster: You do?\nThor: Do what? [they lean in close and just as they are about to kiss Darcy interrupts them; referring to the rain]\nJane Foster: Hey! Is that you? [Thor looks up and the rain stops]\nJane Foster: Uh...we're kind of in the middle of something.\nDarcy Lewis: Um...I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.\nJane Foster: [to Thor] Hold that thought. [she turns and runs towards the police]\nDarcy Lewis: Look at you, still all muscly and everything. How's space?\nThor: Space is fine. [Jane walks over to the police]\nJane Foster: Excuse me?\nPolice Officer #1: Are you Jane Foster?\nJane Foster: Yes.\nPolice Officer #1: [referring to Ian] Do you know this man?\nJane Foster: He's my intern. My intern's intern.\nPolice Officer #1: This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you. You'll have to come with me. [the police officer goes t grab Jane's arm but suddenly the force from the Aether creates a powerful force which pushes the officer and everything else away, Thor runs towards Jane who's lying on the ground]\nThor: Jane! Jane? [he helps her stand] You alright?\nJane Foster: What just happened? [the other police officer approaches Jane apprehensively]\nPolice Officer #2: Place your hands on your head, step back!\nThor: The woman is unwell.\nPolice Officer #2: She's dangerous.\nThor: So am I. [talking into his radio]\nPolice Officer #2: Requesting armed response officers to the scene. [Thor grabs Jane and pulls her closer to him]\nThor: Hold on to me.\nJane Foster: What are you doing? [suddenly the Bifrost opens and Thor takes Jane to Asgard; Darcy looks up as they disappear]\nDarcy Lewis: Holy shit! [Thor and Jane travel through the Bifrost and enter Asgard where Heimdall is guarding as always, Jane looks around her in amazement]\nJane Foster: We have to do that again. [she notices Heimdall for the first time] Hi.\nHeimdall: Welcome to Asgard. [returning to their homeland, Svartalfheim, Malekith kneels and grabs a handful of dust from the ground]\nMalekith: [subtitled] Look at my legacy, Algrim. I barely remember the time before light. [Algrim places his hand on Malekith's shoulder]\nAlgrim: [subtitled] Our survival will be your legacy.\nMalekith: [subtitled] The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world and I'll put an end to this poisonous world. [as the Asgardian physicians study Jane and the force within her]\nJane Foster: What's that?\nEir: Be still. [Thor watches with one of the nurses as they examine Jane]\nThor: This is not of Earth, what is it?\nAsgardian Nurse: We do not know, but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her. [the nurse turns and walks away as Thor looks at Jane with worry]\nJane Foster: That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?\nEir: It's a Soul Forge.\nJane Foster: Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another? [Eir looks impressed]\nEir: Yes. [Jane looks at Thor and whispers]\nJane Foster: It's a quantum field generator. [Thor smiles at her] [Odin enters the room as the Thor looks on to Jane as she is being examined]\nOdin: My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?\nThor: She's ill.\nOdin: She is mortal. Illness is their defining trait.\nThor: I brought here because we can help her.\nOdin: She does not belong here in Asgard anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table. [Jane sits up and looks at Thor]\nJane Foster: Did he just...? [to Odin] Who do you think you are?\nOdin: I'm Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.\nJane Foster: Oh. Well, I'm...\nOdin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster. [Jane turns to look at Thor]\nJane Foster: You told your Dad about me?\nThor: Something is within her, father, something I have not seen before.\nOdin: Her world has its healers, their called doctors, let them deal with it. Guards, take her back to Midgard. [as two guards approach Jane and go to grab her, suddenly the energy force within her sets off again throwing the two guards aside]\nThor: Don't touch her. [he leans down and tenderly touches Jane] Jane, are you alright? [Jane nods her head, Odin inspects the energy force running through Jane's body and realizes it's the Aether]\nOdin: That's impossible.\nEir: The infection, it's defending her.\nThor: No, it's defending itself.\nOdin: Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk. [Odin shows Thor and Jane an ancient book] But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.\nThor: [reading from the book] \"Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light.\" They were these stories mother told us as children.\nOdin: Their leader, Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness, it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appeared as stones, the Aether is fluid and ever changing. It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies, drawing strength from their life force. Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness. But after eternities of blood shed, my father Bor, finally triumphed, ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.\nJane Foster: What happened?\nOdin: He killed them all.\nThor: Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is.\nOdin: The Dark Elves are dead.\nJane Foster: Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?\nOdin: No, it does not. [back on Svartalfheim, in his ship Malekith plots his vengeance against the Asgardians]\nMalekith: [subtitled] The Realms will be aligned soon. [Malekith takes out a knife and turns to Algrim]\nMalekith: [subtitled] You'll be the last of the Kursed. [Malekith stabs Algrim in the stomach with his knife]\nAlgrim: [subtitled] Let my life be sacrificed. The same as our people.\nMalekith: [subtitled] You will become darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you. [one of the dark elves places a molten rock in Malekith's hand and Malekith places it inside Algrim's stomach] And then no power of our enemies will stop me.\nAlgrim: [subtitled] I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe. [Malekith looks to one of his dark elves as he carries a mask] [Fandral and Volstagg return to Asgard with several prisoners, including the masked Algrim; Loki watches them from his cell as they come in]\nLoki: Odin continues to bring me new friends. How thoughtful.\nFrigga: The books I sent, do they not interest you? [Loki turns and we see Frigga is in Loki's cell]\nLoki: Is that how I'm to while away eternity, reading?\nFrigga: I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.\nLoki: Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.\nFrigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.\nLoki: My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king.\nFrigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?\nLoki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.\nFrigga: Your father...\nLoki: [shouts] He's not my father!\nFrigga: Then am I not your mother? [Loki hesitates for a moment]\nLoki: You're not. [Frigga smiles at him with tears in her eyes]\nFrigga: Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [she takes a step towards him and extends her hands, Loki goes to touch her hand but his hand goes through hers and we see that she's a hologram, Loki looks at Frigga with sadness and her hologram disappears] [Jane and Thor walk in Asgard]\nJane Foster: When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.\nThor: Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.\nJane Foster: Well, how's that possible?\nThor: I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence. [he takes her hand and he shows her by touching his palm to hers] During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost. [he leans closer and they kiss]\nJane Foster: I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?\nThor: I'll find a way to save you, Jane.\nJane Foster: Your father said there was...\nThor: My father doesn't know everything. [suddenly they are interrupted by Frigga]\nFrigga: Don't let him hear you say that.\nThor: Jane Foster, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother. [Jane looking embarrassed quickly removes her hand from Thor's mother, Frigga]\nJane Foster: Hi. [in his cell, Algrim pulls out the rock that Malekith had placed in his stomach, he crushes it in his hand, transforming himself into a Kursed, he breaks free and releases the other prisoners, Loki watches all this from his cell, then Algrim walks up to Loki's cell and he look at Loki for a moment before turning and walking away]\nLoki: You might want to take the stairs to the left. [Algrim turns and looks at Loki before walking away again; outside they hear the prison alarm going off]\nFrigga: The prisons.\nThor: Loki.\nFrigga: [referring to Jane] Go, I will look after her. [Thor takes off with his hammer; in the prison Volstagg and Fandral enter the fight with the prisoners]\nFandral: It's as if they resent being imprisoned.\nVolstagg: There's no pleasing some creatures. [as they continue to fight, Loki is sat calmly in his cell reading, suddenly Thor enters and everyone turns to look at him]\nThor: Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word. [suddenly one of the prisoners punches him in the face] Very well, you don't have my word. [Thor punches him back and starts fighting with the other prisoners]\nOdin: [to his guards] Send a squadron to the weapons vault, defend it at all costs. Seal the dungeon.\nFrigga: Odin.\nOdin: Frigga. [to the Asgardian guards] Go! [to Frigga and Jane] It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.\nFrigga: You've never been a very good liar. [at that moment Jane notices Sif as she walks past them]\nOdin: Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.\nFrigga: You take care.\nOdin: Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.\nFrigga: It's only because I worry over you that you have survived. [Odin goes off, Frigga leads Jane away, she takes a sword from one of the guards] Listen to me now, I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.\nJane Foster: Yes, ma'am. [as Heimdall is stood in his usual guarding post, he suddenly hears something turns and runs out onto the Bifrost Bridge, he jumps onto one of Malekith's ships cloaked in invisibility, making it visible and manages to send it crashing into the sea, but he soon finds that a giant ship is behind him releasing smaller ships to attack Asgard, Heimdall activates a shield to protect Asgard but Algrim manages to deactivate it sending a ship to crash into the palace] [after Malekith's ship has crashed into the palace the Dark Elves start attacking the Asgardian soldiers killing them all, Malekith leaves the ship and goes to look for Frigga and Jane after which Odin arrives to find all the soldiers killed]\nOdin: Frigga. [Malekith finds the tower where Frigga is hiding Jane and enters the room]\nFrigga: Stand down, creature. You may still survive this.\nMalekith: I have survived worse, woman.\nFrigga: Who are you?\nMalekith: I am Malekith, and I would have what it is mine. [as he walks closer to Frigga she strikes him in the face with her sword, he takes out his blade and starts fighting with Frigga, she puts up a good fight but Algrim comes to his aid and subdues her, Malekith walks towards Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith stands in front of Jane and as he goes to grab her she disappears and he realizes that she's a hologram, he turns to Frigga] Witch! Where is the Aether?\nFrigga: I'll never tell.\nMalekith: I believe you. [suddenly Algrim stabs Frigga in the back, at the same time Thor rushes in and shoots a lightning bolt at Malekith's face, severely scarring it, he and Algrim escape and jump onto their ship before Thor can catch them; after Malekith and Algrim escape Odin arrives to find Frigga dead, he holds her body in his arms as Thor and Jane look on, a funeral is held for Frigga where all the Asgardians mourn her as her body is pushed out to the sea on a boat and the boat burnt by a flaming arrow, at the same time Loki expresses his grief in his cell] [back on Earth Erik has been institutionalized and is trying to explain the convergence to the patients in his ward]\nErik Selvig: The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle, and once its cycled all the worlds align. [he picks up a shoe and holds it up] Imagine...imagine that this is our world, and...and... [one of the patients hands him another shoe] Oh, thank you. And this is another world. Normally they're separate, but during the alignment everything is connected. All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crunching from one world to the other. [he demonstrates with the shoes by smacking one on top of the other repeatedly] But if this happens to us now, the result would be cataclysmic. [he then puts the shoes down and picks up two pencils and holds them up] My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence. [he puts the pencil down and picks up the shoes again] This time the alignment, and all the other worlds, would just pass up by. It's beautiful. It's simple. Any questions? [we see the patients in the ward just carrying on with their activity, no one has really taken any notice of him, then one of the patients (Stan Lee) interrupts]\nPatient: Yeah. Can I have my shoe back? [on their ship; to Malekith]\nAlgrim: [subtitled] I need your strength to reclaim the Aether. And when you wake up, you will kill them all.[in Asgard, Jane is sat in her room when suddenly the power of the Aether surrounds her and everything around her turns red for a moment, then Volstagg enters the room with two guards]\nEinherjar Lieutenant: Jane Foster. You need to come with us. [Fandral and Odin inspect the damage to the palace where Malekith had crashed his ship]\nFandral: We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless. [Thor approaches them]\nThor: She's your prisoner now? [to Fandral, Volstagg and the guards] Leave us. [they all start walking off and leave Thor with Odin]\nOdin: I do not wish to fight with you.\nThor: Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith.\nOdin: We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.\nThor: Yes, and you will destroy us.\nOdin: You overestimate the power of these creatures.\nThor: No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him.\nOdin: If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.\nThor: The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it.\nOdin: If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.\nThor: And how of our men shall fall on theirs?\nOdin: As many as are needed! [there's a moment pause] We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.\nThor: And how are you different from Malekith? [Odin chuckles]\nOdin: The difference, my son, is that I will win. [Odin turns and walks off] [back on Earth, Darcy paces around her apartment as Ian is sat watching the news on TV]\nDarcy Lewis: Jane isn't called me back. Erik isn't calling me back. Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!\nIan Boothby: What's SHIELD?\nDarcy Lewis: It's a secret. [Darcy leaves a voice message for Erik] Uh...hey, Erik. It's Darcy again. Uh...Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard and um...I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. [as Ian is watching the news they start reporting about Erik being arrested at Stonehenge]\nNews Reporter: Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist, Dr. Erik Selvig, notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge.\nIan Boothby: Darcy, you really need to look at this. Your friend Erik, what was his last name again? [Darcy looks at the news report on TV]\nNews Reporter: ...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm... [Ian presses the pause button on Erik's face from footage taken at Stonehenge, Darcy sits in dismay as she looks at Erik's face on the TV] [in Asgard, Thor is sat alone when Heimdall walks up to him]\nThor: You're not in Odin's war council?\nHeimdall: The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go. [Heimdall takes off his helmet and places it on the table] We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that? [he sits down looking defeated]\nThor: Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help.\n\nHeimdall: I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.\n\nThor: I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief.\nHeimdall: As are we all.\nThor: Well I see clearly enough.\nHeimdall: The risks are too great.\nThor: Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way. [Heimdall hesitates before replying]\nHeimdall: What do you require of me?\nThor: What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard. [we see Thor holding a meeting with Sif, Fandral, Volstagg and Heimdall] We must move Jane off world.\nSif: The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault.\nHeimdall: There are other paths off Asgard, ways known only to a few.\nThor: One, actually. [the others suddenly realize he means Loki]\nVolstagg: No. [Thor walks up to Loki's cell where he is standing looking well kept and clean]\nLoki: Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?\nThor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [suddenly Loki's cell is transformed, the illusion is lifted and we see that Loki's cell is a mess, everything has been thrown around and he's sat on the floor, looking unkempt and messy, in the other corner of the cell]\nLoki: Now you see me, brother. [Thor walks up to the other side of the cell to be closer to Loki] Did she suffer?\nThor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.\nLoki: Go on.\nThor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell. [Loki chuckles]\nLoki: You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?\nThor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you. [Loki smiles]\nLoki: Hmm. When do we start? [back to the meeting with Thor and his comrades]\nFandral: He will betray you.\nThor: He will try. [Loki and Thor walk out of the Asgardian prison]\nLoki: This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?\nThor: If you keep speaking I just might.\nLoki: Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here. [using his diversion tactics Loki turns himself into an Asgardian guard] Is this better?\nThor It's better company at least.\nLoki: Still, we could be less conspicuous. [Loki turns back into himself but turns Thor into Sif] Hm, brother. You look ravishing. [Thor looks down at his body then replies in his own voice]\nThor: It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.\nLoki: Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much. [Loki then turns himself into Captain America in his full Captain America costume] Oh, this is much better. Woh. The costume's a bit much, so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth, honor, patriotism? God bless Amer\u2013 [suddenly Thor grabs hold of Loki puts his hand over his mouth and pushes him against the wall making Loki turn back into himself] What? [Thor looks to the side and they see two Asgardian guards walking away] You could at least furnish me with a weapon. My dagger, something! [Thor looks at him and we hear a noise like a sword being drawn] At last, a little common sense. [Loki then looks down then holds up his hands which now have iron handcuffs on them]\nThor: And I thought you liked tricks. [Thor laughs and turns to walk off] [back at the original meeting Thor was holding with his comrades]\nFandral: Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.\nThor: I won't be the one who comes for her. [Thor looks over to Sif; then we see Jane is sat in her guarded room when one of the guards enters]\nJane Foster: I'm not hungry. [suddenly Sif comes up behind the guard and knocks him out, she looks over to Jane]\nSif: Good, let's go. [Jane and Sif meet up with Thor with Loki standing beside him, Jane points to Loki]\nJane Foster: You're...\nLoki: I'm Loki. You may have heard of... [suddenly Jane slaps Loki hard in the face]\nJane Foster: That was for New York. [Loki smiles and looks at Thor]\nLoki: I like her. [back at Thor's meeting with his comrades]\nSif: And what of the All-Father?\nHeimdall: It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne. [Odin visits Heimdall accompanied by some of his guards]\nOdin: You called me here on an urgent matter. What is it?\nHeimdall: Treason, my lord.\nOdin: Whose?\nHeimdall: Mine. [Heimdall draws his sword, at the same time more guards interrupt them]\nEinherjar Lieutenant: My King, the mortal has been taken. [Odin looks at Heimdall as he commands his guards]\nOdin: Stop Thor, by any means necessary. [as they hear the guards approaching]\nGuards: There they are! Take them. On my command.\nSif: I'll hold them off. Take her.\nThor: Thank you. [Thor and Jane go off, as Loki goes to follow them Sif draws her sword and places it under Loki's throat]\nSif: Betray him and I'll kill you. [Loki chuckles]\nLoki: It's good to see you too, Sif. [Loki leaves to join Thor and Jane as the guards get closer to Sif; back at the original meeting with Thor and his comrades]\nVolstagg: Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.\nThor: That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot. [Thor, Loki and Jane meet Volstagg where Malekith's ship had crashed into the palace]\nVolstagg: I will give you as much time as I can.\n\n[Thor and Volstagg do a forearm shake]\n\nThor: Thank you, my friend. [as they walk towards Malekith's crashed ship, Jane smiles and nods at Volstagg, then as Loki is about to follow Thor and Jane Volstagg stops him]\nVolstagg: If you even think about betraying him...\nLoki: You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line. [Volstagg then lets him pass] [Thor, Jane and Loki board Malekith's crashed ship, Thor looks at the controls and starts pressing some button, looking unsure of what he's doing] I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.\nThor: I said, \"how hard could it be?\" [meanwhile, the Asgardian guards rush towards the ship with Volstagg standing guard in front of it]\nGuard: They're on the ship!\nLoki: They're on the ship! [as they approach the ship Volstagg starts attacking them; back in the ship] Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.\nThor: Shut up, Loki. [outside the ship Volstagg continues to battle with the Asgardian guards; back in the ship Thor continues to frantically press every button to start the ship]\nLoki: You must have missed something.\nThor: No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.\nLoki: No, don't hit it, just press it gently. [as he hits the buttons]\nThor: I am pressing it gently. It's not working! [suddenly the ship comes to life, Thor laughs; outside the ship Volstagg is overrun by the guards.]\nGuards: Get him! Get him!\n[Volstagg starts laughing as they watch the ship start to rise, hitting the columns of the palace]\nLoki: I think you missed a column.\nThor: Shut up! [finally the ship breaks through the palace walls and takes off] [as they are flying through Asgard]\nLoki: Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.\nThor: Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly? [as they are flying over Asgard suddenly Jane collapses]\nLoki: Oh, dear. Is she dead?\nThor: Jane. [Jane raises her head, looking weak]\nJane Foster: I'm okay. [as they continue to fly, the ship hits and breaks off a part of a massive building; to Loki]\nThor: Not a word. [several smaller Asgardian ships start following them]\nLoki: Now they're following us. [the smaller ships start firing at them] Now they're firing at us!\nThor: Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting! [the ship then hits a massive stone monument of King Bor, breaking the head off]\nLoki: Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather. [the smaller ships continue to follow and fire at them as they fly over Asgard] You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant! [suddenly Thor pushes Loki off the ship, Thor then picks up Jane and jumps off the flying ship and lands onto a smaller ship being flown by Fandral, Loki has also fallen onto the ship]\nFandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki. [the Asgardian ships above them continue to follow and fire at Malekith's ship as they think that Thor is still on there] [Thor lays Jane down]\nLoki: You lied to me. I'm impressed.\nThor: I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway. [Loki smiles and takes over the ship's control, at the same time the Asgardian ships spot them and start firing at them] Fandral.\nFandral: Right. [Fandral picks up a rope and steps on to the edge of the ship] For Asgard. [suddenly he jumps off the ship and uses the rope to swing onto the Asgardian ship following them] Nothing personal, boys! [he knocks out the three guards on the ship then looks over to Thor and salutes him; on Fandral's ship Loki flies them towards the mountains]\nThor: Loki!\nLoki: If it were easy everyone would do it.\nThor: Are you mad?\nLoki: Possibly. [Thor holds on to Jane, as Loki heads straight for the wall of the mountain, suddenly they enter right through the mountain and then enter through a portal to Svartalfheim] Ta-da! [on their ship, Algrim approaches Malekith]\nAlgrim: [subtitled] We must attack now.\nMalekith: [subtitled] No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home. [as they fly over Svartalfheim, Jane continues to lie down and Thor puts a cover over her]\nLoki: [sighs] What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.\nThor: It would consume you.\nLoki: She's holding up alright, for now.\nThor: She's strong in ways you'd never even know.\nLoki: Say goodbye.\nThor: Not this day.\nLoki: This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.\nThor: And will that satisfy you?\nLoki: Satisfaction is not in my nature.\nThor: Surrender not in mine.\nLoki: The son of Odin.\nThor: No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!\nLoki: Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!\nThor: What help were you in your cell?\nLoki: Who put me there? Who put me there?! [Thor grabs hold of Loki]\nThor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [Thor raises his fist to punch Loki but stops himself] She wouldn't want us to fight.\nLoki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked. [they both smile]\nThor: I wish I could trust you. [Thor turns his back to Loki]\nLoki: Trust my rage. [back on Earth, Darcy and Ian go to free Erik from the mental institution]\nDesk Officer: You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig. [Ian looks distracted and Darcy nudges him to bring him to attention]\nIan Boothby: What? Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig. [Ian goes to sign the form]\nDesk Officer: One; a man's leather wallet, brown. One key ring with three keys. Prescription medicine. [he places the, wallet, key ring with the keys and a plastic bag containing medicine bottles on the counter] Various. [the officer then bends to pick up another item from behind the counter, at the same time Darcy notices Erik being escorted towards them]\nDarcy Lewis: Erik.\nDesk Officer: And... [the officer places Erik's gadgets on the counter] These.\nIan Boothby: Yeah, those. Thank goodness. [as Erik comes towards Darcy]\nDarcy Lewis: Erik.\nErik Selvig: Yes?\nDarcy Lewis: It's uh...Darcy.\nErik Selvig: Darcy. [Darcy holds up her hands and smiles, Erik then hugs her] It's so good to see you.\nDarcy Lewis: Uh...I missed you too. [Darcy looks awkward as Erik continues to hold her tightly]\nErik Selvig: How did you find me?\nIan Boothby: You were naked on TV.\nDarcy Lewis: Okay, time to go. Lots to do. [Erik continues to hold her] Getting weird now. [as they walk down the corridor of the mental institution with Ian holding Erik's gadgets] I should not be left in charge of stuff like this, I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid period. [Erik takes his bag of medicine from Ian]\nIan Boothby: I'm uh...Ian by the way. Uh..Darcy's intern. I don't get paid either. [Ian watches as Erik takes out a bottle of pills] Are you alright?\nErik Selvig: I have had a God in my brain. I don't recommend it. [as they step out of the building suddenly the gadget in Ian arms starts to beep]\nIan Boothby: Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.\nErik Selvig: It's happening, sooner than I calculated.\nDarcy Lewis: Wait, what's happening? [they look up to see flock of birds flying above them] Birds? Birds are happening?\nIan Boothby: They're starlings, it's called a murmuration. My dad used to take me bird watching as a kid.\nDarcy Lewis: Erik?\nErik Selvig: Look. [suddenly the birds all fly in the same direction and they all suddenly disappear]\nDarcy Lewis: Where did they go? [suddenly all the birds appear behind, them flying away frantically making Darcy screams in terror] What the hell was that?! [Erik smiles] Why are you smiling?\nErik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are. [he walks ahead and throws his bag of medicine into the garbage bin nearby] Take me to Jane's lab! [on Svartalfheim, as they continue flying on their ship suddenly Jane's eyes open, it's clear that the Aether has taken her over, she rises and looks ahead]\nThor: Jane.\nJane Foster: Malekith. [after landing their ship, they walk over to watch Malekith and his men in the distance]\nThor: Alright, are you ready? [Jane nods her head]\nLoki: I am. [they rise from their hiding spot and Malekith spots them standing on a hill in the distance] You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.\nThor: Yeah, possibly. [Loki holds up his shackled hands for Thor to uncuff him]\nLoki: You still don't trust me, brother?\nThor: Would you? [Thor takes off Loki's cuffs]\nLoki: No, I wouldn't. [suddenly Loki takes out a dagger stabs Thor and throws him down the hill]\nJane Foster: Thor! No! [Malekith sees this and starts walking towards them] [after stabbing Thor and throwing him down the hill, Loki walks over to Thor]\nLoki: You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you? [he kicks Thor in the stomach] All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet! [Thor raises his hand, attempting to summon Mjolnir, but Loki cuts off his hand making Thor scream out in pain, Jane rushes over to Thor but Loki grabs her and turns to face Malekith and his dark elves] Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift! [he throws Jane at Malekith's feet] I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.\nAlgrim: [to Malekith] [subtitled] He is an enemy of Asgard, he was locked in a cell. [Malekith walks over to Thor squirming in pain on the ground]\nMalekith: Look at me. [Malekith uses his foot to turn Thor, he then lifts Jane in the air and extracts the Aether from her, in that moment Jane has a vision of Earth, then as the Aether leaves her body Jane falls to the ground]\nThor: Loki, now! [Loki uses his diversion tactics and we see that he had never amputated Thor's hand, Thor quickly summons Mjolnir and shoots lightning at the Aether attempting to destroy it, but he fails as Malekith is still able to absorb it and turns to leave on his ship] [two of the dark elves start attacking Thor but he quickly takes them down, Algrim then throws one of his vortex weapons in the air, Loki pushes Jane away and he is nearly sucked in when Thor pulls him out, Thor then attacks Algrim but he beats Thor down, Loki goes over to them and impales Algrim from behind, Algrim slowly turns and suddenly pulls Loki into the blade that is sticking out from him] No! [Algrim takes a step towards Loki]\nLoki: See you in hell, monster! [Algrim then realizes that attached to the blade in him is his own vortex weapon, it explodes before he can do anything destroying him; Thor then rushes over to Loki]\nThor: No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!\nLoki: I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool! [Loki squirms in pain]\nThor: Stay with me, okay?\nLoki: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\nThor: Shh.\nLoki: I'm sorry.\nThor: It's okay. [Thor nods his head] It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.\nLoki: I didn't do it for him. [he closes his eyes and as he dies his skin turns to it's blue Frost Giant form, Thor cries out in anguish]\nThor: No! [Thor looks at Jane as he weeps for Loki] [after Loki's death, Thor and Jane enter a cave as they see a storm approaching]\nJane Foster: He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.\nThor: How? Jane, how?\nJane Foster: I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?\nThor: The Convergence.\nJane Foster: Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.\nThor: Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner.\nJane Foster: I only found it because I was looking for you.\nThor: Jane. [he places his hand on her face]\nJane Foster: Now we're trapped here. [suddenly they hear music playing, Jane and Thor look at each other in confusion]\nThor: It's not me. [Jane realizes it's her cell phone, she takes it out of her pocket and answers it]\nJane Foster: Hello?\nRichard: Hi, Jane, it's Richard.\nJane Foster: Richard?! Where are you?\nRichard: I'm still in the office. It's...It's been a crazy day here today. [Jane puts him on speaker and holds up her phone]\nJane Foster: Oh, my God! This is amazing.\nRichard: Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.\nJane Foster: How am I getting service here?\nRichard: Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you there?\nJane Foster: No, no, no, no! Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.\nRichard: Okay then. I was just wondering if you want to try again? Uh...maybe dinner next time.\nJane Foster: Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...just stay on the phone, okay?\nRichard: Yeah, I will. [Jane looks down and notices can and keys that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]\nJane Foster: Oh, my God. [Jane picks up the keys from the floor of the cave]\nRichard: Am I interrupting something.\nJane Foster: No, no, no, nothing at all. [realizing how they can return to Earth, Jane turns to Thor] Come on.\nRichard: I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel? [Thor starts following Jane]\nThor: Where are we going?\nRichard: [to Jane] Hello? [they start walking further into the cave, Thor notices the discarded shoes that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]\nThor: Why are there so many shoes in here? [as they walks further in suddenly they disappear; back in his office Richard loses Jane on the phone]\nRichard: I'll just text her. [Jane and Thor appear back on Earth outside the factory, they get into Ian's abandoned car still parked outside the factory and Jane tries to start the car]\nDarcy Lewis: Jane!\nJane Foster: Hey.\nDarcy Lewis: You can't just leave like that, the whole world is going crazy! [Thor hangs his hammer on the coat hanger next to the door] All the stuff we saw is spreading. [she looks at Jane's Asgardian clothes and disheveled state] Did you go to a party? [Jane notices Erik for the first time]\nJane Foster: Erik?!\nErik Selvig: Jane, how wonderful! [he rises and goes to Jane and as he embraces her we see he isn't wearing any pants] You've been to Asgard.\nJane Foster: Where are your pants?\nIan Boothby: Oh, uh...he uh...he says it helps him think.\nJane Foster: Okay. Well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.\nErik Selvig: Okay.\nThor: Are you well, Erik? [Erik chuckles then his smile fades quickly]\nErik Selvig: Your brother is not coming, is he?\nThor: Loki is dead.\nErik Selvig: Oh, thank God. [Thor looks at him in confusion] I...I'm so sorry.\nThor: Thank you. [Erik then embraces Thor] [back on Svartalfheim we see an Einherjar Guard use the ship that brought Thor, Loki and Jane onto the planet to return to Asgard, he goes to see Odin at the palace]\nEinherjar Guard: Forgive me, my liege. I've returned from the Dark World with news.\nOdin: Thor?\nEinherjar Guard: There's no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but... [he takes a step closer to Odin]\nOdin: What?\nEinherjar Guard: We found a body. [there's a moment's pause]\nOdin: Loki. [the warrior doesn't reply but just looks at Odin] [back at Jane's apartment]\nJane Foster: Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connected.\nErik Selvig: Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.\nThor: Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time.\nDarcy Lewis: Well, how do we know where that is?\nErik Selvig: We follow the directions. This has happened before, thousands of years ago, and The Ancients were there to see it. [Erik places a map of the British Isles on the coffee table] All the great constructions: the Mayas, the Chinese, the Egyptians, they made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence. And they left us a map. [he starts drawing on the map] Stonehenge. Snowdon, the Great Orme. These are all coordinates taking us...here. [he points to Greenwich on the map]\nIan Boothby: Greenwich?\nJane Foster: The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increase and decrease in gravity, spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart. [Thor summons Mjolnir and it shoots over to Thor's hand from the where it was hanging on the coat hanger]\nErik Selvig: I better get my pants. [in Greenwich at the location outside a library Darcy and Ian grab Erik's gadget]\nDarcy Lewis: Focus, this is important. We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.\nIan Boothby: They're taped together!\nDarcy Lewis: Do you even know what these things do?\nIan Boothby: No.\nDarcy Lewis: Neither do I. [Darcy and Ian start placing Erik's gadgets around the library grounds] Come on, come on!\nIan Boothby: Fine! [suddenly Malekith's giant ship appears on the River Thames near the library grounds]\nDarcy Lewis: Holy shit! [the ship starts moving forward and crashing through the library grounds causing pandemonium until it finally stops in the middle of the grounds, Malekith and his dark elves step off the ship and the same time Thor flies in and lands in front of Malekith]\nMalekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian! Death would have come to you soon enough.\nThor: Not by your hand!\nMalekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be extinguished. [Malekith uses the power of the Aether to attack Thor but Thor manages to narrowly miss getting hit by it] [inside the library setting up the gravimetric device]\nErik Selvig: We're running out of time.\nJane Foster: Almost there.\nErik Selvig: Are you sure this is going to work? These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.\nJane Foster: Oh, come on. [Jane looks out and sees Thor and Malekith battling it out] Come on, Darcy. [Jane rushes off to find Darcy; outside Thor manages to deflect the Aether that Malekith is using to fight him off]\nThor: You know with all that power, I thought you would hit harder. [as Malekith is using the Aether to shield himself suddenly Thor throws his hammer at him which throws Malekith across the ground and smashes him against the library building, at the same time Jane sees Darcy and Ian placing the last of Erik's device in the ground]\nIan Boothby: Done. [Darcy gives the OK sign to Jane and Jane rushes back to Erik]\nErik Selvig: The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.\nJane Foster: That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight. [Jane gets the device ready] Okay, you might wanna hold on to something. [she turns on the device and suddenly some of the dark elves suddenly disappear; Darcy and Ian watch this nearby, Darcy talks to Jane on her phone]\nDarcy Lewis: That is awesome! How did you do that?\nJane Foster: Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating...\nDarcy Lewis: Oh, there's a guy with a sword! [Jane uses the device again to make the dark elf disappear but instead she accidentally makes Darcy and Ian disappear]\nJane Foster: Oops.\nErik Selvig: Let's go. [Darcy and Ian appear in another part of London]\nDarcy Lewis: What the hell just happened? [suddenly the dark elves that had also disappeared appear and fall onto a parked car] Move! [Darcy grabs hold of Ian's hand and they run off as the dark elves start chasing after them; back at the library Thor and Malekith continue their battle and everyone inside the library rushes to the windows to watch]\nJane Foster: What are you all doing? You need to get out of here! Now!\nStudent: You're joking, right? That's Thor out there waving his hammer around and everything! [he uses his phone to record the battle outside; in their ensuing fight, Thor and Malekith are transported through the realms to Svartalfheim and London continuously, at the same time a fighter jet flies towards Malekith's ship]\nControl: Confirming ship is hostile.\nPilot: Confirm, the ship is hostile. You have permission to engage.\nControl: Roger. The missile's locked. The missile's on its way. [the pilot releases the missile] Missile off target! I repeat...\nPilot: Mayday! I'm losing control. Mayday! Mayday! I'm losing control! [the jet is then transported to Valaheim] [as they run through the library ground]\nErik Selvig: What are you doing?\nJane Foster: My signal's lost connection. [some of the dark elves are behind them chasing after them]\nErik Selvig: Jane! Come on! [as Thor and Malekith continue their battle through the realms they land in Jotunheim and are confronted by a giant beast which then is transported to London, at the same time Darcy and Ian are being ambushed by the dark elves when Ian, with the help of the anti-gravitational energy force, grabs a car and throws it at them, Darcy looks at him in shock]\nIan Boothby: Are you alright?\nDarcy Lewis: You saved my life.\nIan Boothby: Yeah. Yes, I did. [back at the library grounds Jane manages to make the device work again and as she uses it suddenly makes Darcy and Ian appear behind her in each others arms kissing]\nJane Foster: Darcy?\nDarcy Lewis: Jane! [Darcy lets go of Ian and falls to the ground]\nErik Selvig: Ian?\nIan Boothby: Selvig! [suddenly Mjolnir appears and flies past them]\nDarcy Lewis: Meowmeow! [Thor and Malekith are then transported through the realms again with Malekith landing back in Greenwich but Thor ends up in Charing Cross Underground Station]\nMan: [over speakers] Mind the gap.\n[Thor turns to one of the passengers on the underground train that's just arrived]\nThor: How do I get to Greenwich?\nWoman on Train: Take this train, three stops. [Thor steps onto the train and places his hand on the bar above him]\nMan: [over speakers] Mind the gap.\n[as the train starts to move, the movement causes the woman to fall against Thor and she stops herself by placing her hand on his chest]\nWoman on Train: Sorry. Sorry. [Thor smiles politely at her]\n[in Greenwich the realms come closer to converging, Malekith readies the Aether within him to bring forth the darkness]\nJane Foster: We're out of time. [Jane rushes off ahead]\nErik Selvig: Jane. Jane! [Thor rushes out of the station to watch the Aether taking over]\nJane Foster: Thor! We're too late.\nErik Selvig: The Convergence is at its peak. [Thor looks at the gadget spears in Erik's hand]\nThor: Can those things stop him?\nErik Selvig: Not from here.\nJane Foster: We can't get close enough. [Thor looks at Jane]\nThor: I can. [Thor takes the spears from Erik and rushes off towards Malekith] [Thor pushes through the Aether and reaches Malekith] Malekith! [Malekith turns to face Thor]\nMalekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?\nThor: I've come to accept your surrender. [Thor throws one of Erik's gadget spears at Malekith and he catches it, Jane uses the gavemetric which makes his arm disappear and we see it transported to Svartalfheim, Thor throws the other spear at Malekith and he catches it and his other arm disappears]\nMalekith: You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.\nThor: But you can. [Thor summons Mjolnir at the same time he rushes towards Malekith and as he grabs his hammer he uses it to throw Malekith into his ship and Jane is able to use her device to transport him Svartalfheim] [after Thor kills Malekith Jane goes to find Thor and finds him lying on the ground, suddenly Malekith's ship starts to crumble, Jane rushes towards the unconscious Thor]\nJane Foster: Thor! No! [Jane turns Thor over grabs his arm and starts to pull him out of the way but he is too heavy, just them Erik, Darcy and Ian arrive on the scene]\nErik Selvig: Jane! [the ship starts to fall, as Jane is not able to move Thor she throws herself on top of him and holds on to him with her eyes closed, just as the ship is about to land on them it disappears and appears on Svartalfheim landing on Malekith and crushing him to death; back in Greenwich] Everybody okay? [Thor becomes conscious and opens his eyes, Darcy smiles and throws her arms around Ian and kisses him passionately] [couple of days later, Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian are in her apartment sat having breakfast quietly]\nDarcy Lewis: He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for, like, two years.\nJane Foster: Well, it's only been two days, so...\nErik Selvig: Did he say anything before he left?\nJane Foster: Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father. He kind of committed treason... on our way out. [Jane looks away and carries on eating her breakfast]\nErik Selvig: Oh.\n\n[On Asgard Thor meets with Odin at the palace]\nOdin: You once said there would never be a wiser King than me. You were wrong. The alignment has brought all the realms together. Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them. What can Asgard offer its new King in return?\nThor: My life. Father, I cannot be King of Asgard. I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair. Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will. The brutality, the sacrifice, it changes you. I'd rather be a good man than a great King.\nOdin: Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?\nThor: When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice? [Odin sighs] This is not for Jane, Father. She does not know what I came here to say. Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side, it changes nothing.\nOdin: One son who wanted the throne too much, another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?\nThor: Loki died with honor, I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [Odin nods his head, Thor then holds up Mjolnir to offer it back to Odin]\nOdin: It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.\nThor: I shall try to be.\nOdin: I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.\nThor: I know. [Thor turns to leave]\nOdin: If I were proud of the man my son had become, even that I could not say. It would speak only from my heart. Go, my son. [Thor smiles]\nThor: Thank you, father. [he turns and starts walking off, as Odin watches Thor walk off Odin's form transform to reveal Loki]\nLoki: No. Thank you. [Loki smiles devilishly] [mid-credits scene; Sif and Volstagg are taken to meet, The Collector Taneleer Tivan]\nCollector's Assistant: I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.\nThe Collector: Woh, Oh. Asgardians, it's an honor. [he bows theatrically]\nSif: You know why we're here.\nThe Collector: Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure in your own vault?\nVolstagg: The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.\nThe Collector: That's very wise. [Sif hands the Aether over to The Collector] I can assure you it will be absolutely safe in...in my collection.\nSif: See that it is. [The Collector bows his head, Sif and Volstagg turn and leave]\nThe Collector: One down, five to go. [after credits scene; at her apartment Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian hear the sounds of thunder, Jane looks out and smiles as she sees lightning, Jane walks out onto her balcony as Thor appears, they embrace and start kissing passionately; at the same time we see the beast transported from Jotunheim running amok outside the abandoned factory]\n\n\n[Thor arrives to provide backup to Sif and the Warriors Three]\nSif: I've got this completely under control!\nThor: Is that why everything's on fire?\n . . .\n[the marauders bring out a rock monster to battle Thor]\nSif: All yours. [steps back]\nThor: Hello. [the beast roars] I accept your surrender.\n[the marauders roar with laughter; Thor uppercuts the beast with Mjolnir, reducing it to a pile of rubble]\nThor: Anyone else?\n\n\nLoki: [mock salute to Odin] I really don't see what all the fuss is about\u2026\nOdin: Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death!\nLoki: I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you.\nOdin: We are not gods. We're born, we live, we die, just as humans do.\nLoki: Give or take five thousand years.\nOdin: All this because Loki desires a throne...\nLoki: It is my birthright!\nOdin: Your birthright was to DIE! As a child, cast out on a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now, to hate me.\nLoki: If I'm for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't like our little talks, it's just... I don't love them.\nOdin: Frigga is the only reason you're still alive, and you will never see her again. You'll spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.\nLoki: And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf King while I rot in chains?\nOdin: Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the Nine Realms, and then, yes, he will be King.\n\n\nDarcy: Come on, this is exciting. Look! The intern is excited.\nIan: Ian, my name's Ian.\nDarcy: Do you want the phase meter?\nJane: No.\nDarcy: Bring the phase meter. The toaster looking thing.\nIan: Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.\n\n\n[Thor and Jane reunite]\nThor: Jane?\n[she walks up to him and slaps him]\nJane Foster: Sorry. I just\u2026needed to make sure you were real. It's been a very strange day.\nThor: I am. Jane\u2014\n[she slaps him again]\nJane: Where were you?!\nThor: Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.\nJane: I was right here where you left me! I was waiting, and then I was crying, and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back.\nThor: I know. I know, but the Bifr\u00f6st was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos. Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging\u2026I had to put an end to the slaughter.\n[she looks at him blankly for a moment]\nJane: As excuses go, it's not\u2026terrible\u2026But I saw you on TV! You were in New York!\nThor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong. I was a fool. I believe that fate brought us together.\n[they embrace]\n\n\nMalekith: [looking out over the ruins of Svartalfheim] Look upon my legacy, Algrim. I can barely remember a time before the light.\nAlgrim: Our survival will be your legacy.\nMalekith: The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world. And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.\n\n\nOdin: She does not belong in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet!\nJane: Did he just-? Who do you think you are?\nOdin: I am Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.\nJane: Oh. Well I'm-\nOdin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.\nJane: [to Thor] You told your dad about me?\n\n\nFrigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.\nLoki: My actions? I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life\u2026that I was born to be a king.\nFrigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?\nLoki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.\nFrigga: Your father\u2014\nLoki: He's not my father!\nFrigga: Then am I not your mother?\nLoki: You're not.\nFrigga: [looks hurt but chuckles] You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [Loki looks sorry and reaches for her but she disappears]\n\n\n[Malekith bursts into Frigga's chamber, hunting for Jane]\nFrigga: Stand down, creature, and you may still survive this.\nMalekith: I have survived worse, woman.\nFrigga: Who are you?\nMalekith: I am Malekith... [looks at Jane] and I would have what is mine. [They both draw swords and duel, until Algrim arrives and helps overpower Frigga. Malekith turns to confront Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith discovers Jane is an illusion and angrily faces a grinning Frigga] WITCH! Where is the Aether?!\nFrigga: I'll never tell you.\nMalekith: I believe you. [Algrim kills Frigga]\n\n\nLoki: Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?\nThor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [Loki and the neat room turn to a destroyed room with Loki looking disheveled on the floor]\nLoki: Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer? [referring to Frigga]\nThor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.\nLoki: Go on.\nThor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell.\nLoki: [chuckles] You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?\nThor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you.\nLoki: Hm. When do we start?\n\n\n[Jane meets Loki]\nJane: You're\u2026\nLoki: I'm Loki. You may have heard\u2014\n[she hauls off and slaps him]\nJane: That was for New York!\nLoki: [to Thor] I like her.\n . . .\nSif: Betray him, and I'll kill you.\nLoki: Good to see you too, Sif.\n . . .\nVolstagg: If you even think about betraying him\u2026\nLoki: You'll kill me? Evidently, there will be a line.\n\n\nLoki: You know, this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us! It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant- [Thor shoves Loki out of the ship, and jumps out with Jane in his arms into a skiff piloted by Fandral]\nFandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful, Loki!\nLoki: [to Thor] You lied to me. I'm impressed.\n\n\nLoki: [steering the skiff towards a tiny crevice in the mountain] If it were easy, everyone would do it.\nThor: Are you mad?\nLoki: Possibly.\n\n\nThor: You think you alone were loved of Mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!\nLoki: Trust? Was that her last expression, trust? While you let her die?!\nThor: What good were you in your cell?\nLoki: Who put me there? Who put me there?!\nThor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [pins Loki and is about to hit him but lets him go] She wouldn't want us to fight.\nLoki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.\nThor: [chuckles] I wish I could trust you.\nLoki: [whispers] Trust my rage.\n\n\nThor: [holding a dying Loki] I will tell Father what you did here today.\nLoki: I didn't do it for him.\n\n\n[a flock of birds disappears into thin air, then reappears flying out of the ground near Ian, Darcy, and Dr. Selvig]\nDarcy: What the hell was that? [to a grinning Dr. Selvig] Why are you smiling?\nDr. Erik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.\n\n\nMalekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian. Death would have come to you soon enough.\nThor: Not by your hand!\nMalekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be EXTINGUISHED!\n\n\nMalekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?\nThor: I've come to accept your surrender.\nMalekith: You think you can stop this?! The Aether cannot be destroyed!\nThor: But you can. [summons Mjolnir and deals the final blow to Malekith]\n\n\nOdin: One son who wanted the throne too much, and another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?\nThor: Loki died with honour. I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [offers the hammer]\nOdin: It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.\nThor: I shall try to be.\nOdin: I can not give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.\nThor: I know. [turns to leave]\nOdin: If I were proud of the man my son has become, even that I could not say, it would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.\nThor: Thank you, Father. [leaves]\nLoki: [appears from Odin's guise] No... thank you.\n\n\n[mid credits scene; Sif and Volstagg arrive in an alien collection]\nCarina: I present to you Taneleer Tivan. The Collector.\n[the Collector, looking like an alien Liberace, appears and bows]\nThe Collector: Asgardians! It's an honor.\nSif: You know why we're here. [she hands him the Aether, which he accepts]\nThe Collector: Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure, in your own vault?\nVolstagg: The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It would be unwise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.\nThe Collector: That's very wise. I can assure you, it will be absolutely safe here in my collection.\nSif: See that it is.\n[the Asgardians leave]\nThe Collector: One down\u2026five to go.\n\n\n\n"

A hint of what's to come.\n         1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1\n         A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set\n         amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves\n         down the street and heads out of town.\n         2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2\n         The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels\n         of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a\n         variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point\n         at the sky.\n         JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She\n         positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the\n         constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from\n         spare parts of other devices.\n                        JANE\n         Hurry!\n         We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.\n         Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as\n         well, rubbing his head.\n         JANE (CONT'D)\n         Oh-- watch your head.\n                        SELVIG\n         Thanks.

SUV - NIGHT 3\n         The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring\n         equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held\n         together with duct tape.

Shatner.\n                        SELVIG\n         That's your \"subtle\"\u009d aurora?!\n                        JANE\n         No-- yes! Let's go!\n         4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4\n         The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange\n         event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body\n         out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.\n         The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs\n         her, yanks her back in.\n         5 INT. SUV 5\n         Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.\n                        JANE\n         Isn't this great?!\n         A thought strikes her.\n         JANE (CONT'D)\n         You're seeing it too, right? I'm\n         not crazy?\n                        SELVIG\n         That's debateable. Put your seat\n         belt on!\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.\n         The SUV lurches.\n         6 EXT. DESERT 6\n         Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from\n         out of the clouds comes --\n         AN ENORMOUS TORNADO\n         Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a\n         thousand freight trains as it touches down.\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.\n         7 INT. SUV 7\n         Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the\n         enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers\n         into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the\n         window, TAPING the storm.\n                        JANE\n         You've gotta get us closer so I can\n         take a magnetic reading.\n         Darcy laughs.\n                        DARCY\n         Yeah, right! Good one!\n         (then, realizing)\n         Oh God, you're serious...\n                        JANE\n         You want those college credits or\n         not?\n         8 EXT. SUV 8\n         The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane\n         leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs\n         two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds\n         take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING\n         strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before\n         them with a terrifying intensity.\n         9 INT. SUV 9\n         The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns\n         the wheel, starts to head away.\n                        DARCY\n         Keep the credits. I'll intern at\n         Burger King.\n                        JANE\n         What are you doing?!\n                        DARCY\n         Saving our lives!\n         Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They\n         struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --\n                        A MAN\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.\n         Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy\n         slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.\n         The SUV swerves -- but too late.\n         10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10\n         The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending\n         him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.\n         11 INT. SUV 11\n         Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.\n         They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.\n         A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.\n         12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12\n         The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the\n         man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,\n         charred and blackened.\n                        DARCY\n         I think that was legally your\n         fault.\n                        JANE\n         Get the first aid kit.\n         Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels\n         next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.\n         She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him\n         clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,\n         long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted\n         features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing\n         the life back into him.\n         JANE (CONT'D)\n         Come on, big guy. Do me a favor\n         and don't be dead, okay? Open your\n         eyes and look at me.\n         Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as\n         his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,\n         azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto\n         them.\n         For a moment, they each forget to breathe.\n         The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She\n         freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A.\n                        DARCY\n         Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I\n         know CPR.\n         A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.\n         She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.\n                        JANE\n                        HIS EYES--\n                        DARCY\n                        (DREAMILY)\n         --are beautiful.\n                        JANE\n         --are dilating.

A thought strikes her.\n                        JANE\n         Where did he come from?\n         They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last\n         glowing remnants of the storm, and into:\n         13 EXT. SPACE 13\n         EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and\n         resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.\n         HEIMDALL (V.O.)\n         Questions, they've always asked\n         questions -- this race called man,\n         on this planet they call earth.\n         Passionately longing to know how\n         they are connected to the heavens.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.\n         We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,\n         cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our\n         galaxy.\n         HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n         In ages past, they looked to us as\n         gods, for indeed so many times we\n         saved them from calamity. We tried\n         to show them how their world was\n         but one of the Nine Realms of the\n         Cosmos, linked to all others by the\n         branches of Yggdrasil...\n         We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,\n         sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague\n         shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching\n         out into the black void of space.\n         HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n         ...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in\n         a universe of wonder, beauty, and\n         terror that they barely\n         comprehended.\n         We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like\n         a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.\n         HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n         But for all their thirst for\n         knowledge, they let our lessons\n         fall into myth and dreams.\n         Where did he come from? He came\n         from us, the proudest race of\n         warriors the Worlds have ever seen.\n         He came from this -- the greatest\n         Realm the universe has ever known.\n         We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then\n         over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal\n         what's on the other side:\n         HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n         He came... from Asgard!\n         14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14\n         Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent\n         landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,\n         modern yet timeless.\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6A.\n         15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15\n         The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an\n         other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled\n         out before it.\n         We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE\n                        STANDS --\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.\n                        ODIN ALLFATHER\n         Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,\n         land at his side.\n         16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16\n         Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a\n         vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.\n                        ODIN\n         Do you think he's ready?\n                        FRIGGA\n         He thinks he is. He has his\n         father's confidence.\n                        ODIN\n         He'll need his father's wisdom.\n                        FRIGGA\n         And his humility?\n         Odin reacts.\n         FRIGGA (CONT'D)\n         Thor won't be alone. Loki will be\n         at his side to give him counsel.\n         Have faith in your sons.\n                        ODIN\n         Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He\n         could be a great King...\n         Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of\n         synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail\n         as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,\n         trying to stop the strange event through the force of his\n         sheer will.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.\n         Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.\n         A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.\n         ODIN (CONT'D)\n                        (QUIETLY)\n         ...if we only had more time.\n                        FRIGGA\n         For once, our son needs something\n         we cannot provide.\n                        ODIN\n         I can fight it a little longer...\n                        FRIGGA\n         No. You've put it off too long! I\n         worry for you.\n         He touches her cheek.\n                        ODIN\n         I've destroyed demons and monsters,\n         devastated whole worlds, laid waste\n         to mighty kingdoms, and still you\n         worry for me?\n                        FRIGGA\n         Always.\n                        ODIN\n         Not today. Now come kiss your\n         king... while I'm still king.\n         He pulls her close, and they kiss.\n         17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17\n         Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners\n         hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the\n         fire lit room.\n         Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted\n         against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we\n         recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.\n         Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.\n         An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.\n         He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly\n         below.\n                        THOR\n         Another!\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.\n         The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow\n         intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full\n         length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.\n         He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of\n         the Hall.\n         We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively\n         shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great\n         horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,\n         from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his\n         horned headpiece.\n         Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by\n         a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded\n         throne room.\n                        LOKI\n                        (TO THOR)\n         Nervous, brother?\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9.\n                        THOR\n         Have you ever known me to be\n         nervous?\n                        LOKI\n         There was the time in Nornheim...\n                        THOR\n         That wasn't nerves, brother. It\n         was the rage of battle. How else\n         could I have fought my way through\n         a hundred warriors and pulled us\n         out alive?\n         The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for\n         Thor.\n                        LOKI\n         As I recall, I was the one who\n         veiled us in smoke to ease our\n         escape.\n                        THOR\n         Some do battle, others just do\n         tricks.\n         The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like\n         it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.\n         EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and\n         across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the\n         goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.\n         THOR (CONT'D)\n         Loki...\n         Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn\n         back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.\n         THOR (CONT'D)\n         Now that was just a waste of good\n         wine.\n                        LOKI\n         Just a bit of fun.\n         (to the Attendant)\n         Right, my friend?\n         The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED\n         HELMET.\n         LOKI (CONT'D)\n         (re: Thor's helmet)\n         Nice feathers.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A.\n                        THOR\n         You don't really want to start this\n         again, do you, Cow?\n                        LOKI\n         I was being sincere!\n                        THOR\n         You're incapable of sincerity.\n                        LOKI\n         Am I?\n         He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.\n         LOKI (CONT'D)\n         I've looked forward to this day as\n         long as you have. You're my\n         brother and my friend. Sometimes\n         I'm envious, but never doubt that I\n         love you.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.\n         Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.\n         He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good\n         liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his\n         brother's shoulder.\n                        THOR\n         Thank you.\n         The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:\n                        LOKI\n         Give us a kiss.\n                        THOR\n         Stop.\n         Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.\n         THOR (CONT'D)\n         How do I look?\n                        LOKI\n         Like a king.\n         They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.\n         LOKI (CONT'D)\n         It's time.\n                        THOR\n         You go ahead.\n         Loki casts him a wary look.\n         THOR (CONT'D)\n         I'll be along. Go on.\n         Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.\n         17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A\n         VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big\n         event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE\n         stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then\n         eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.\n         FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his\n         moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN\n         holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on\n         dreamily.\n                        FANDRAL\n         Thank you, love.\n         (to the Maidens)\n                        (MORE)\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10A.\n                        FANDRAL (CONT'D)\n         Now who'd like to polish my sword\n         for me?\n         The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.\n         HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front\n         of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and\n         the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL\n         ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.\n         Hogun turns his head, gives him a look.

We\n         reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons\n         on the table.\n                        SIF\n         (to the weapons)\n         I'll miss you.\n         18 INT.

THRONE ROOM - DAY 20\n         Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki\n         and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the\n         hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,\n         the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into\n         formation. They part to reveal --\n                        ODIN\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.\n         Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He\n         holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in\n         him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a\n         Ruler of Asgard.\n         Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,\n         casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be\n         seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.\n         A murmur spreads through the crowd.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         (sotto, to Loki)\n         Where is he?\n                        LOKI\n         He said he'd be along.\n         Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         What?\n                        SIF\n         He wants to make an entrance.\n                        FANDRAL\n         Well, if he doesn't show up soon,\n         he shouldn't bother.

The CROWD erupts in\n         CHEERS. Thor spins his hammer with a flourish, holds it up\n         before the crowd, basking in the moment, relishing the\n         adoration, whipping his audience up into a frenzy.\n                        SIF\n         Oh, please.\n         Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.\n         21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21\n         As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold\n         breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to\n         warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing\n         something's not right.\n         They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's\n         hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a\n         pedestal.\n         LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and\n         SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.\n         22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22\n         Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front\n         of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.\n         Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at\n         her. She can't help but smile.\n         Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.\n         The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless\n         authority.\n         He raises Gungnir before him.\n                        ODIN\n         Gungnir. Its aim is true, its\n         power strong. With it I have\n         defended Asgard and the lives of\n         the innocent across the Nine Realms\n         since the time of the Great\n         Beginning. And though the day has\n         come for a new King to wield his\n         own weapon -- that duty remains the\n         same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my\n         first-born.\n                        (MORE)\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13A.\n                        ODIN (CONT'D)\n         So long entrusted with this mighty\n         hammer, Mjolnir.

Who\n         wields this hammer commands the\n         lightning and the storm. Its power\n         has no equal -- as a weapon, to\n         destroy, or as a tool, to build.\n         It is a fit companion for a King.\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 14.\n         23 INT. VAULT - DAY 23\n         The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now\n         strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just\n         catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large\n         and BLUE-SKINNED.\n         One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns\n         to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the\n         Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something\n         standing in the shadows behind it.\n         As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.\n         They turn back around.\n         Now it's their turn to SCREAM.\n         24 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 24\n         The Ceremony continues.\n                        ODIN\n         Today I entrust you with the\n         greatest honor in all the Nine\n         Realms. The sacred throne of\n         Asgard. I have sacrificed much to\n         achieve peace. So, too, must a new\n         generation sacrifice to maintain\n         that peace. Responsibility, duty,\n         honor. These are not merely\n         virtues to which we must aspire.\n         They are essential to every soldier\n         and to every King.\n         The Crowd and the Warriors Three start to shiver and rub\n         their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the\n         hall.\n         Thor turns back to face his father.

ICE\n         creeps across the surface of the large banners around the\n         hall, making an eerie CRACKING sound. Thor, his comrades,\n         and the crowd see it too.\n         ODIN (CONT'D)\n                        (REALIZING)\n         Frost giants...\n         The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the\n         palace below.

Badly.\n         Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the black metal\n         creature, a fiery glow coming from within it.\n         It is THE DESTROYER.

He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,\n         intimidating face virtually concealed by armor.

Volstagg walks beside the frustrated Loki, needles\n         him.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         What happened?

HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30\n         Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a\n         platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus\n         at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23.\n                        HEIMDALL\n         Be warned.

RAINBOW BRIDGE 31\n         The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into\n         the Observatory.\n         32 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32\n         Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The\n         Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a\n         section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his\n         sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,\n         the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.\n         The Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor\n         and his five comrades stand.\n                        HEIMDALL\n         All is ready. You may pass.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         Couldn't you just leave the bridge\n         open for us?\n                        HEIMDALL\n         To keep this bridge open would\n         unleash the full power of the\n         Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with\n         you upon it.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         Ah. Never mind, then.\n         Thor starts towards the Bifrost, turns back to the others,\n         grins.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 23A.\n                        THOR\n         Come on. Don't be bashful.\n         The others join him at his side, then step towards the\n         Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,\n         changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being\n         elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked\n         off the platform and inside the vortex.\n         33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33\n         A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting\n         out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor\n         and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are\n         imprinted on the ice around them.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.\n         Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly\n         grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling\n         precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's\n         inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.\n                        THOR\n         Come on, big fella. Up...!\n         With an effort, Thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the\n         ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         This belt!

The whole planet\n         is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking\n         apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges\n         and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks\n         and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun\n         city lies in the distance.\n                        HOGUN\n         We shouldn't be here.\n                        THOR\n         Too late now.\n                        FANDRAL\n         Actually, it's not.

The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too\n         proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and\n         his people have endured.\n                        LAUFEY\n         I am Laufey, King of this Realm.\n                        THOR\n         And I am--\n                        LAUFEY\n         We know who you are, Odinson.

The other Jotuns step in\n         front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost\n         Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet\n         tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores\n         him.\n                        LOKI\n         Thor, stop and think. Look around\n         you.

Thor stares Laufey down\n         a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades\n         breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant\n         nearby mutters under his breath.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.\n                        JOTUN\n         Run back home, little princess.\n         Thor stops in his tracks.

The Asgardians reluctantly\n         draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.\n         Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         Silly hammer! Has a mind of its\n         own!\n         ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR\n         around them, extending off the ends of their arms like\n         SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.\n                        FANDRAL\n         I'm hoping that's just decorative.\n         Thor leaves the circle of Asgardians, swings at another Frost\n         Giant. His comrades form another circle around him,\n         separating him from the Jotuns, as he whirls his hammer\n         around once and catches it with a cocky grin. He's enjoying\n         this.\n                        THOR\n         Next!\n         Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.\n                        FANDRAL\n         Well? What move, do you think?\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         I say we use \"The Norn's Revenge.\"\u009d\n                        FANDRAL\n         At this close range? I think \"The\n         Alfheim Lunge\"\u009d is a better move.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n                        (DISGUSTED)\n         Maybe if they were three feet tall!\n         No! How about \"The Randy\n         Valkyrie\"\u009d?\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A.\n                        HOGUN\n         Shut up!\n         Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks\n         loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.\n         A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant\n         hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his\n         mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and\n         hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over\n         him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins\n         back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun\n         with his mace.\n         Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her\n         double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground.\n                        SIF\n         If you don't treat me like a lady,\n         I won't act like a lady!\n         She takes out the Jotun.\n         Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at\n         the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,\n         swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.\n         The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes\n         out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the\n         crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness.\n                        LOKI\n         (to the falling Giant)\n         Pathetic.\n         He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from\n         either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at\n         once.\n         Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.\n         The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then\n         punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a\n         long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in\n         front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.\n         Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.\n                        THOR\n         Come on! At least make it a\n         challenge for me!\n         He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a\n         tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor\n         rises, grins.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.\n         THOR (CONT'D)\n         Now that's more like it!\n         He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute\n         head over heels.\n         Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies\n         back to his grasp.\n         THOR (CONT'D)\n         (re: the fallen Brute)\n         Ugly and stupid.\n         Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the\n         ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.\n         Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his\n         sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in\n         the chest. The Jotun falls dead.\n                        SIF\n         (to Hogun, re: knife)\n         I'm so glad I taught him how to do\n         that!\n         Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good\n         hits in.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         You may want to put some ice on\n         that!\n         The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in\n         a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.\n         Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.\n         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\n         You may be taller, but I'm wider!\n         Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him\n         flying.\n         Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and\n         sending him crashing to the ground.\n         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\n         It's not too late for you to\n         surrender.\n         Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's\n         bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the\n         Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing\n         Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.\n         Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's\n         ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.\n         Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies\n         to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he\n         opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes\n         out a small FLASK.\n         Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells\n         to his comrades.\n         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\n         Don't let them grab hold of you!\n         He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the\n         battle.\n         Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword\n         stops mid ice layer.\n         The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,\n         and the warrior drops to one knee.\n         Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one\n         quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using\n         her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's\n         chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.\n         VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)\n         (on his belly)\n         Thank you, my lady. But I nearly\n         had him!\n                        SIF\n         Of course you did.\n         Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling\n         them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the\n         bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into\n         the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them\n         out.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29.\n         A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH-\n         FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground.\n         Volstagg notices, hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he\n         goes.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         Hang on!\n         Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around\n         Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly\n         worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously\n         close to hacking into Hogun's legs.\n                        HOGUN\n         Watch the legs!\n                        VOLSTAGG\n                        (REALIZING)\n         Right. Sorry.\n         Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally\n         freeing Hogun's feet.\n         Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant.\n                        FANDRAL\n         You really think your icicles are a\n         match for Asgardian steel?\n         Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade\n         away.\n         FANDRAL (CONT'D)\n         Fair enough.\n         Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's\n         sword and snaps it in half.\n         FANDRAL (CONT'D)\n         Could we stop just a moment while I\n         get another sword?\n         Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun\n         then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of\n         the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant\n         through with his own weapon.\n         The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a\n         pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,\n         forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,\n         rendering him helpless.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.\n         Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and\n         felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-\n         unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights\n         them off.\n         Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled Fandral.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         That's unfortunate.\n         He hurries to his wounded comrade.\n                        FANDRAL\n         I may need a bit of help. Not a\n         good look, is it?\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         Just try not to bleed.\n                        FANDRAL\n         How's the face?\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         Flawless.\n         Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice\n         stalagmite.\n         Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost\n         Giants.\n         The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his\n         hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's\n         grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees\n         his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.\n         Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead\n         of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE\n         -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads\n         painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.\n         The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the\n         unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the\n         distraction, KICKS the Giant.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.\n         Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts\n         the Jotuns around him.\n                        THOR\n         Come on!\n         But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost\n         Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor\n         from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.\n         Mjolnir falls to the ground.\n         A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the\n         ground, to no avail.\n         Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg\n         slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to\n         leave.\n         From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides\n         it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the\n         palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the\n         wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.\n         The Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their\n         feet.\n                        LOKI\n         That can't be good.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         Yes, it could! Might be an early\n         spring!\n         They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see\n         shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN WARRIORS\n         awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the battle.\n         Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of the Giants.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 31.\n                        LOKI\n         Thor, we must go!\n         Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes\n         mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the\n         look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat\n         of battle.\n                        THOR\n         Then go!\n                        SIF\n         There are too many of them!\n                        THOR\n         I can stop them!\n         The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all\n         around them.\n                        SIF\n         Thor!\n         But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         Run!\n         Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of\n         the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give\n         chase.\n         Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of them.\n         The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he\n         disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a\n                        MOMENT --\n         THOR'S FIST\n         Forces its way up through the middle of the pile of Jotuns.\n         He opens his hand, beckoning.\n         One of Thor's attackers hears something ROARING up behind\n         him. He whirls around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him square in\n         the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor\n         raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground\n         with all his might.\n         KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer\n         channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the\n         Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive\n         shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.\n         But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the\n         shockwave continuing to spread outwards.

The swirling mists\n         quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.\n         The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes\n         a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not\n         move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.\n         Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He\n         raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off\n         the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his\n         comrades.\n         35A EXT.

And there are HUNDREDS of them -- too\n         many, even for a Thunder God.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n                        (TO LOKI)\n         Actually, could you bring the mists\n         back, please?\n         Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead.\n         The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening\n         ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts\n         down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom\n         comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of\n         all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --\n                        ODIN ALLFATHER\n         Astride his powerful, eight-legged steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad\n         in battle armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an imposing sight.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32A.\n         The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks,\n         stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians.\n         Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath\n         his feet raises him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to\n         react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-\n         to-face with Odin.\n         Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure what's\n         about to happen.\n         Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that as powerful as the\n         Allfather still is, the years have taken their toll. He's\n         not the foe he once was. The two rulers talk quietly, out of\n         earshot of the others.\n                        ODIN\n         Laufey. End this.\n                        LAUFEY\n         Your boy sought this out.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33.\n                        ODIN\n         You're right.

You and I can stop this\n         before there's further bloodshed.\n         Unseen by Odin and the others, Laufey starts to form an ice\n         blade at the end of his arm.\n                        LAUFEY\n         We are beyond diplomacy now,\n         Allfather. He'll get what he came\n         for -- war and death.\n         Odin looks grim, determined.\n                        ODIN\n         So be it.\n         Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but\n         Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon\n         the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards\n         in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet.\n         The other Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the\n         fleeing Jotuns with delight.\n                        THOR\n         Now! We'll finish them together!\n                        ODIN\n         Silence!\n         Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the\n         Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops\n         the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the\n         hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent.\n         Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.\n         36 INT.

The turret turns, the Bifrost energy building along\n         with Odin's rage.

HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43\n         Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens on\n         a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in his\n         arm.\n                        NURSE\n         Hi.

Now a\n         couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all\n         struggling to hold Thor down.

Thor\n         looks shocked and amazed that he's actually being overpowered\n         by this small group.

NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAWN 44\n         Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls\n         his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge.

He redoubles his efforts,\n         strains with all his might, with no luck.\n         He takes off his hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious\n         object.\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41.\n          TOWNIE (CONT'D)\n          Huh.\n         45 EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45\n         The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light.\n         Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast\n         desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at\n         her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment.\n         A printer churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the\n         Bifrost footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall.\n         Selvig surveys the scene, watches how Jane works, impressed.\n         He notices a monitor which displays a complex program\n         entitled \"J.

HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 47\n         Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his\n         wrists now.

HEALING ROOM - DAY 53\n         Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell-\n         shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a\n         ROARING central fire.\n         Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls out some fragile HEALING\n         STONES. Neither the fire, nor the stones burn him. As he\n         carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades,\n         the stones begin to glow. He crushes them to a powder. His\n         comrades' injuries heal up at the glowing powder's touch.\n         Fandral winces in pain as Hogun heals his gaping wound.\n         Volstagg looks at the skin on his arm -- healing, but still\n         blackened from the necrotizing touch of the Frost Giant.\n         Loki watches him, then stares at his own arm, where the\n         Giant's touch turned his skin blue. It's undamaged, back to\n         its normal color.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         We should never have let him go.\n                        SIF\n         There was no stopping him.\n                        FANDRAL\n         At least he's only banished, not\n         dead. Which is what we'd all be if\n         that guard hadn't told Odin where\n         we'd gone.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         How did the guard even know?\n         Loki stares at his arm.\n                        LOKI\n         I told him.\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.\n                         FANDRAL\n         What?\n                        LOKI\n         I told him to go to Odin after we'd\n         left.

You must go to the\n         Allfather and convince him to\n         change his mind!\n                        LOKI\n         And if I do, then what? I love\n         Thor more dearly than any of you,\n         but you know what he is. He's\n         arrogant. He's reckless. He's\n         dangerous. You saw how he was\n         today.

ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61\n         Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin\n         lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the\n         space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep.

The Driver\n         raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.\n         He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and\n         catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then\n         hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing\n         the ATV's spotlight.\n         Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off\n         the wheel to protect himself.\n         The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube\n         entrance.

A digital read-out gives information on the\n         distance to the target. He locks in on Thor, who's inside\n         the plastic tubing, emerging from the junction box and\n         heading towards the cube structure.\n         BARTON (CONT'D)\n         Hello, handsome.\n         83A INT. TUNNEL 83A\n         Thor races through the tunnel, comes across a wall of AGENTS.\n         Thor ROARS and barrels through them -- elbowing, punching --\n         whatever it takes to keep moving.\n         As he takes down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction\n         box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead.\n         He races towards it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the\n         middle of the structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a\n         fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw, sending him\n         reeling. Dazed, Thor looks up to see --\n         A HUGE SHIELD AGENT\n         The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer\n         in the cube structure beyond. Thor sizes him up.\n                        THOR\n          You're big.\n         Thor grins.\n          THOR (CONT'D)\n          Fought bigger.\n         83B EXT.

TUNNEL 83D\n         Coulson hurries through the tunnel, ready to give the word to\n         Barton, when he stops short. He sees what looks like an\n         electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead,\n         directly above the crater... and the hammer.\n         83E EXT.

CRATER 84\n         Thor and the Huge Agent struggle to stand in the mud.\n         Through the translucent walls of the cube structure, Thor\n         sees Mjolnir. The Huge Agent rises up before him, blocking\n         his view.\n         Rain and blood run down Thor's face. He lunges forward,\n         whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing\n         the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as\n         Thor's momentum carries him past.\n         Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge\n         Guard grabs his ankle in a last effort. Thor looks back down\n         at his foe, then drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into\n         the fallen Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain,\n         defeated.\n         Thor races back towards the structure.\n         84H INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84H\n         From outside, Thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the\n         structure.\n         He stands there -- soaking, bleeding, caked with wet earth.\n         His hammer rests just a few yards before him, energy surging\n         around it.\n         Coulson steps into the structure through an access tunnel,\n         one story up.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 68B.\n         As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow\n         brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The\n         crackling energy seems to reach out to him. Coulson notices,\n         his interest piqued.\n         Above the open ceiling of the structure, Barton's crane\n         bucket comes into view.\n         84I EXT. CRANE BUCKET 84I\n         Wind and rain whip around Barton as he stares into his rifle\n         site, locked on the back of Thor's head -- his finger on the\n         trigger.\n         84J INT. HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84J\n         Thor stands next to the hammer, feels its power. He reaches\n         out to it confidently.\n         Coulson watches from above. Armed AGENTS approach behind\n         him. He motions for them to hold their positions, then\n         radios Barton.\n                        COULSON\n         Barton...\n         84K EXT.

HAMMER CONTAINMENT CUBE 84L\n         Coulson watches Thor with anticipation as Thor wraps his hand\n         around the hammer. He smiles, triumphant, lifts... but the\n         hammer doesn't move.\n         Thor looks confused, tries again with two hands, to no avail\n         -- anger and frustration overtaking him. He strains with all\n         his might, SCREAMS from the effort, bellowing up at the storm\n         and lightning above him.\n         Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- glowing\n         RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them.\n         But, still, the hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his\n         knees before it, rain pouring down around him, as the glowing\n         runes fade away. He's failed. Unworthy.\n         Coulson looks on, disappointed.\n         SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding him.\n         Coulson activates his radio.\n                        COULSON\n         Ground units, move in. Show's\n         over.\n         As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or\n         care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the\n         rain -- a man broken, lost.\n         From overhead, we see the hammer in the cube containment\n         room. We pull up as the Guards approach Thor, then continue\n         to climb, until we see the whole camp -- and the extensive\n         damage Thor's done to it during the melee.\n                        85 OMITTED 85\n         86 EXT.

She hears\n         the sound of DOGS and SHIELD AGENTS approaching, sees the\n         glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her.\n         With no other choice, she makes a quick retreat.\n          4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 69A.\n         87 EXT.

The fury of\n         the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but\n         SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight\n         towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but\n         still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried.\n         Heimdall is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his\n         massive sword at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen,\n         just inches from Loki's throat.

The explosion is\n         massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust\n         enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --\n                        JANE\n         Oh. My.

Thor swings\n         Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the\n         Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder\n         God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale\n         force winds.\n         Debris from the battle begins to rise up into the sky. The\n         Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its massive weight.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 101.\n         It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its faceplate,\n         locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor dives downwards\n         straight at it, with Mjolnir before him.\n         Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast,\n         overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at the\n         Destroyer.\n         Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.\n         The fiery energy within the creature builds up and EXPLODES\n         within him, firing out of all his openings.\n         Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous\n         heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.\n         Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its\n         lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and debris\n         pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the\n         skies, around the Destroyer, burying it.\n         Jane and Thor's comrades, now roused, stand to join him.\n         A battered Coulson approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.\n                        COULSON\n         Donald...

As the Jotun king falls to the ground,\n         we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding\n         Gungnir.\n                        LOKI\n         And your death came by the son of\n         Odin.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A.\n         Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for\n         Loki.

He's thrown by the scene before him -- Odin safe, Laufey\n         and two Jotuns dead, Frigga regarding Loki with pride and\n         respect.

Before he can, Loki\n         fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor,\n         blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the\n         ice as Thor staggers to his feet.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.\n         LOKI (CONT'D)\n         You can't stop it.

Thor catches it in his\n         hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow,\n         but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back\n         towards the frozen controls.\n         Loki spins around, aims Gungnir, and fires a blast which\n         immobilizes Thor in the air. He hangs there, suspended.\n                        THOR\n         Is the throne really worth what\n         you've done?

Perhaps when we're\n         finished here I'll pay her a little\n         visit myself.\n         That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and\n         their weapons collide.\n         The two battle -- Loki unleashing years of pent-up rage and\n         jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.\n         155 EXT.

Loki fires Gungnir, sending\n         Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his\n         hand.\n         The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.\n         Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it\n         back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too\n         powerful.\n         Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides\n         towards the Bifrost.\n                        LOKI\n         If you care so much for the Jotuns,\n         then die with them.\n         The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to\n         drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he\n         concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand\n         towards the Bifrost.\n         MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.\n         The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another\n         blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his\n         brother.\n         158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158\n         Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and\n         land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets\n         to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.\n                        LOKI\n         Thor! Help me!\n         Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking\n         up at him desperately.\n         LOKI (CONT'D)\n         Please...\n         Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his\n         brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just\n         then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls\n         around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.\n         Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls\n         him across the bridge.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.\n         Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind\n         him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.\n         It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next\n         to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.\n         Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,\n         never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The\n         Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.\n                        LOKIS\n         I was always more clever than you.\n                        THOR\n         Yet still not clever enough.\n         With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,\n         summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then\n         channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the\n         Lokis.\n         All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real\n         Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir\n         knocked from his grasp.\n         Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his\n         back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps\n         away.\n         Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks\n         confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop\n         his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's\n         pinned to the ground.\n         Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing\n         towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of\n         energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to\n         do.\n         Loki watches him smugly.\n                        LOKI\n         Look at you, the Mighty Thor.\n         With all your strength, what good\n         does it do you now?\n         Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's\n         happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,\n         VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy\n         feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.\n         He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.\n         Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The\n         hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.\n         Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,\n         thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he\n         channels the power of the storm into it, then --\n         He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is\n         massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking\n         the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears\n         where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.\n         LOKI (CONT'D)\n         Stop! What are you doing?!\n         Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!\n         The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream\n         out from it. Loki thinks fast.\n         LOKI (CONT'D)\n         If you destroy the Bridge, you'll\n         never see her again!\n         Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor\n         through the back.\n                        THOR\n         Forgive me.\n         Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises\n         Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all\n         sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --\n         KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING\n         out of it.\n         Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of\n         the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the\n         Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.\n         The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.\n         As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of\n         Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall\n         towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out\n         from the broken Bridge.\n         They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive\n         force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized\n         by the debris, when --\n         A POWERFUL HAND\n         Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir\n         as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to\n                        SEE --\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 112.\n                        ODIN ALLFATHER\n         Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the\n         Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.\n         Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of\n         approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is\n         disappointment and regret.\n         Loki lets go.\n         THOR (CONT'D)\n         No!\n         But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki\n         falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries\n         him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the\n         Observatory, disappearing out of sight.\n         Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back\n         into his father's arms.\n                        ODIN\n         It is over.\n         159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159\n         The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing\n         in all directions.\n         Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.\n         Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the\n         significance of what's just happened.\n                        JANE\n         It's gone.\n         160 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160\n         A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three\n         sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between\n         Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting\n         their battle with the Destroyer.\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         ...and then, with a mighty bellow,\n         I flew at the great metal beast and\n         laid it low...\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113.\n                        FANDRAL\n         Is that another way of saying you\n         fell on your huge a--\n                        VOLSTAGG\n         As a matter of fact, falling down\n         was a tactic. Lulling the\n         Destroyer into a false sense of\n         security!\n                        FANDRAL\n         Well, I was the one who had to drag\n         your enormous carcass off the\n         battlefield. That makes me the\n         real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?\n         Hogun points to Volstagg.\n                        HOGUN\n         Big stomach.\n         (points to Fandral)\n         Big mouth.\n         The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral\n         look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a\n         smile.\n                        FANDRAL\n         Well, how about that? A smile!\n         I'd say that calls for another\n         drink!\n         They laugh and raise another round.\n         Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the\n         sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches\n         Frigga, bows her head.\n                        SIF\n         My Queen. I am so sorry for your\n         loss.\n         Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.\n                        FRIGGA\n         Thank you, Sif.\n         She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around\n         him.\n         FRIGGA (CONT'D)\n         How is he?\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113A.\n                        SIF\n         He mourns for his brother. And he\n         misses her. The mortal.\n         Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at\n         Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall.\n                        FRIGGA\n         He will need his friends now more\n         than ever.\n                        SIF\n         I will always be at his side.\n         Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.\n         161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161\n         Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin\n         walks up behind him.\n                        ODIN\n         You'll be a wise King.\n                        THOR\n         There will never be a wiser king\n         than you. Or a better father.\n                        (THEN)\n         I have much to learn. I know that\n         now. But some day, perhaps, I will\n         make you proud.\n                        ODIN\n         You've already made me proud.\n         Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.\n         162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162\n         Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost\n         energy, drifting off into space.\n         Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.\n         Thor stares out at the stellar void.\n         4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 114.\n                        THOR\n         Can you see her?\n         Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.\n                        HEIMDALL\n         Yes.\n                        THOR\n         How is she?\n         163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163\n         Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged\n         ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull\n         away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly\n         inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see\n         that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research\n         facility, abuzz with activity.\n         SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-\n         the-art equipment.\n         Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the\n         SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass\n         windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the\n         roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at\n         hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE\n         before her, which bears the \"STARK INDUSTRIES\"\u009d logo.\n         From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive.\n                        DARCY\n         Here you go.\n                        JANE\n         Thanks.\n         Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.\n                        DARCY\n         He would have come back if he\n         could.\n                        JANE\n         I know. But if he can't get here\n         on his own...\n         Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D\n         HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device,\n         bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is --\n         YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.\n          JANE (CONT'D)\n          ...maybe we can help him find his\n          way back.\n         164 OMITTED COMBINED WITH SCENE 163 ABOVE 164\n                         FADE OUT:\n                         THE END\n"

No!\nI knew something was different\nbefore I got the shot off.\nHe had it on him when he bolted.\nIs that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?\nShe is no longer a factor.\nWe closed that door to him a long time ago.\nHe's alone.\nHe wants to be alone.\nBut see if he's been talking to anybody.\nForgive me, sir?\nDoesn't anybody want to talk\nabout what went down in there? 'Cause...\nHe didn't lose us.\nAnd he was not alone, sir. We had him.\nAnd then something hit us, something...\nSomething big hit us!\nIt threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!\nIt was the most powerful thing\nI've ever seen.\nWell, it's gone.\nWell, if Banner knows what it is,\nI'm gonna track him down,\nI'm gonna put my foot on his throat\n- and I'm gonna...\n- That was Banner.\nIt\nwas Banner.\n- You have to explain that statement, sir.\n- No, I don't.\nYou've done a good job.\nPack up and get our men on a plane.\nWe're going home.\nWait.\nPlease.\nWhere am I?\nI've run into bad situations\non crap missions before.\nI've seen good men go down\npurely because someone didn't let us know\nwhat we were walking into.\nI've moved on to the next one,\nbecause that's what we do, right?\nI mean, that's the job.\nBut this?\nThis is a whole new level of weird.\nAnd I don't feel inclined\nto step away from it.\nSo if you're taking another crack at him,\nI want in.\nAnd, with respect, you should be looking\nfor a team that's prepped and ready to fight,\nbecause if that thing shows up again,\nyou're gonna have a lot of professional\ntough guys pissing in their pants.\nSir.\nTienes ms stretchy?\nYeah. Perfecto.\nLet me emphasise\nthat what I'm about to share with you\nis tremendously sensitive,\nboth to me personally and the Army.\nYou're aware that we've got an\nInfantry Weapons Development programme.\nWell, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram\nfor Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.\nYeah, Super Soldier.\nYes.\nAn oversimplification, but yes.\nAnd I dusted it off, got 'em doing\nserious work again, bold work.\nAcross the hall,\nthey were trying to arm you better.\nWe were tryin' to make you better.\nBanner's work was very early phase.\nIt wasn't even weapons application.\nHe thought he was working\non radiation resistance.\nI would never have told him\nwhat the project really was.\nBut he was so sure of what he was onto,\nthat he tested it on himself.\nAnd something went very wrong.\nOr it went very right.\nAs far as I'm concerned, that man's\nwhole body is the property of the US Army.\nYou said he wasn't working\non weapons, right?\n- No.\n- But you were. You were, weren't you?\nYou were trying other things.\nOne serum we developed\nwas very promising.\n- So why did he run?\n- He's a scientist.\nHe is not one of us.\n- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?\n- 39.\n- It takes a toll, doesn't it?\n- Yes, it does.\nSo get out of the trenches.\nYou should be a Colonel by now,\nwith your record.\nNo, I'm a fighter.\nI'll be one for as long as I can.\nYou know, if I could take what I know now,\nput it in the body I had ten years ago,\nthat would be someone\nI wouldn't want to fight.\nI could probably arrange\nsomething like that.\nTake care, kids.\nStan, I give you my word,\nwhatever you've heard about me,\nit's not true.\nOh, I know it. I always knew it.\nI mean, you know how I felt about you two.\n- Have you talked to her?\n- No.\nShe doesn't know that I'm here.\n- She's with somebody?\n- Yeah, he's a head shrink.\nThey say he's one of the best.\nBut a really nice guy.\nGood. That's good.\n- Bruce, what can I do to help you?\n- I could use a bed for a few nights.\n- You can have the spare room upstairs.\n- That'd be so great.\nThere is one other thing.\nExcuse me. Pardon me.\nComing through.\nHey, pal. I got a delivery on five.\nI don't think there's anybody up there.\nOh, man. I'm gonna catch hell\nif I don't collect. You got to let me try.\nI'll tell you what. I got an extra medium.\nTake it on the house.\n- You are the man.\n- God bless you, brother.\nAll right.\nOkay.\nWe're pretty well closed here, folks.\nI'm sorry.\nOh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.\nOh, kids.\nI got nothing but marinara now.\nOh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.\nShe worked through dinner again,\nof course.\nStan?\nAnd he... I go, \"So, yeah,\nI mean, where were you?\n\"I can't... I don't know\nwhere you were, Cecil.\"\nAnd he goes, \"Not where you been at.\"\nI thought, \"Oh, my God.\" I just felt so awful.\nBruce?\nBetty? What's going on?\nBetty...\nJust tell me if I saw what I think I saw.\n- I don't know what to say.\n- Please, just tell me the truth.\nDon't go. Don't go.\nI want you to come with me now.\nPlease. Come with me.\nPlease.\nIt's our data.\nI got in there before they carted it all away.\nI hoped somewhere that it might tell us\nsomething someday.\n- Does the General know that you have this?\n- No, I don't think so.\nI haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.\nYou have to be sure.\nBruce, I don't understand why we can't\njust go in there together and talk to him.\nHe told me what he wanted to do.\nHe wants it out of me.\nHe wants to dissect it\nso that he can replicate it.\nHe wants to make it a weapon.\n- Hi.\n- Hi.\n- I thought you might want to...\n- Thanks.\nListen, I should leave early,\nas early as I can.\nReally? You can't stay at all?\nI want to,\nbut it's just not safe for me to be here.\n- If I could borrow some cash...\n- Of course.\nI need to take a bus.\nWell, at least let me walk you to the station.\nOkay.\n- You have everything you need?\n- Yeah.\nI...\nWhat?\n- Good night.\n- Good night.\nI hope you get some rest.\nWe're giving you a very low dose only.\nI need you sharp out there and disciplined.\nFirst sign of any side effect,\nwe stop and you're off team\nuntil you straighten out.\n- Agreed?\n- Agreed.\nYou'll get two separate infusions.\nOne into the deep muscle,\none into the bone marrow centres.\nThe bone ones are going to hurt.\nIs everything okay?\nI think so.\nCome here.\n- I just wanna do this.\n- Oh.\n- It's better like that.\n- Yeah?\nIt feels too tight, huh?\n- Yeah, a little.\n- Okay.\n- What?\n- They're here.\n- Betty, look at me, look at me!\n- Bruce!\nYou have to go far away\nfrom me as you can!\n- Don't argue with me, just go. Go!\n- Bruce!\nDamn it! We'd have had snipers on target\nin three more minutes.\nI wanna know who jumped the gun.\nHe's heading 2-7-0.\nBlonsky! Not yet!\nSir.\nLook alive. This could get interesting.\nI got him!\nStop! Stop!\nI know you're in there!\nGeneral, please!\nSir?\nDad!\n- Dad, please don't do this.\n- You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.\nThere he is!\nTarget is in the overpass. We have a visual.\nDo not engage! Repeat, do not engage!\nHe's locked in.\nPut two canisters in there with him.\nFire!\nGet her back here!\nNow she'll see.\nAlpha team?\nLet him have all of it.\nCome on, light him up!\nWhere are the fifty cals? Move your asses!\nOh, my God!\nBlonsky, now you're up!\nSir?\nCover me.\nRemember me?\nMy God, he's doing it.\nMove him toward the cannons!\nMove!\nHold your position!\nDo it now!\nPlease, please, please, no!\n- Please, please, please!\n- Get her back!\nYou're killing him!\nStop! Get off of me!\nBruce!\nBruce! Bruce!\nWhere's the gunship?\nIs that it?\nBlonsky, pull back now.\nPull back!\nIs that all you got?\n- Fall back!\n- Fall back! Let's go, let's go!\nFind cover!\nBetty!\nFire, goddamn it!\nBruce?\nStop firing!\nNo!\nYou did the right thing, calling us.\nI need to know where they're going.\nShe'll be in incredible danger\nas long as she's with him.\nFrom who?\nHe protected her. You almost killed her.\nI give you my word, her safety\nis my main concern at this point.\nYou know, it's a point\nof professional pride with me\nthat I can always tell\nwhen somebody's lying.\nAnd you are.\nI don't know where he's going.\n- I know she'll help him, if she can.\n- Then she's aiding a fugitive.\nAnd I can't help either one of them.\nI used to wonder\nwhy she never talked about you.\nNow I know!\nWhere does she meet these guys?\nBruce?\nBruce.\nIt's okay. It's okay.\nCome here. Come this way.\nWatch your head.\nOkay.\nWe're okay.\nIt's okay.\nIt's just the rain.\nWill he ever walk again?\nMost of the bones in his body\nlook like crushed gravel right now.\nI will say this for him.\nHe's got a heart like a machine.\nNever seen anything like it,\noutside of a racehorse.\nHere.\nOkay.\nBruce?\nOh, hi.\nAre you okay?\nYeah.\nYeah, actually, I feel a lot better.\n- Good.\n- I just had to get my data back.\nYou ate it?\nWell, you know, the circumstances\ncalled for a little improvisation.\nWow.\nOkay, so they didn't have a great selection,\nbut I got you some options.\nFirst thing's first.\nOh, you're kidding me.\nWhat?\n- No.\n- They were the stretchiest pair they had.\nI'll take my chances.\nRumours continue\nto swirl about a violent clash\nbetween forces of the US military\nand an unknown adversary\non the campus of Culver University\nearlier today.\nSophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson\nwitnessed some of the battle.\nIt was so big.\n- It was like this huge, like, hulk!\n- Yeah.\nMcGhee, who happens\nto be a reporter for the campus paper,\ncaptured this on his cell phone.\nFurther search for the mysterious \"hulk\"\nwas postponed by powerful thunderstorms\nin the Smoky Mountain National Forest.\nNot too short back there.\nI have done this before, you know.\nI don't know how you've done this\non your own for all this time.\nWith clippers, usually.\n- Wait, wait, wait. Wait.\n- What? What?\nWe can't do this.\n- It's okay. I want to.\n- No.\nNo.\nI can't.\nI can't get too excited.\nNot even a little excited?\nIt's okay.\nSir, it's Blonsky.\nHas anyone found out\nif he has next of kin or family?\nAsk him yourself.\nSir?\n- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier.\n- Thank you, sir.\nHow do you feel?\nPissed off and ready for round three.\nBasically, we can't use any of this,\nbecause they can track all of it.\nWell, my lip gloss? Can they track that?\n- No. You can take your lip gloss.\n- Thank you.\n- Well, I need my glasses.\n- Well, you can take\n- your glasses and your watch, okay?\n- Okay.\nWe can use most of it. We just can't use\nthe credit cards, the ID or the phone.\n- Don't even turn that on.\n- Okay.\nAnd we'll take the cash, obviously.\nHow will we get where we need to go\non $40 and no credit cards?\nWell, we could sell this.\nNo. No, that's the only thing\nyou have left from her. No.\nWell, we'll have to try and get it back.\nFederal is\nalready monitoring phones,\nplastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,\nand local PD have been placed on alert.\nThey'll pop up somewhere\nand when they do, it comes straight to us.\nThey're not gonna just pop up.\nHe made it five years and got across borders\nwithout making any mistakes.\nHe's not gonna use a damn credit card now.\nIf he was trying to escape,\nhe'd be long gone.\nHe's not trying to escape this time.\nHe's looking for help\nand that's how we're gonna get him.\nWe know what they're after and we know\nhe's been talking to somebody.\nYou all have copies of the correspondence.\nThe aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue\nhave been added to the\nSHIELD Operations Database.\nIf he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.\nIf he makes a peep, we'll hear him.\nAnd when he slips up, we'll be ready.\nHey.\nSmile.\nWhat is it like?\nWhen it happens, what do you experience?\nRemember those experiments\nwe volunteered for at Harvard?\nThose induced hallucinations?\nIt's a lot like that,\njust a thousand times amplified.\nIt's like someone's poured\na litre of acid into my brain.\n- Do you remember anything?\n- Just fragments. Images.\nThere's too much noise.\nI can never derive anything out of it.\n- But then it's still you inside it.\n- No. No, it's not.\nI don't know.\nIn the cave, I really felt like it knew me.\nMaybe your mind is in there,\nit's just overcharged\nand can't process what's happening.\nI don't want to control it.\nI want to get rid of it.\nAre you ready?\nLet's even the playing field a little.\nGentlemen.\nBruce, wake up.\nThere's something going on.\nWe got to go. Walk toward the back.\nJust don't move too fast.\nAll right. Come.\nIt is a long way uptown.\nI think the subway's probably quickest.\nMe in a metal tube, deep underground,\nwith hundreds of people\nin the most aggressive city in the world?\nRight. Let's get a cab.\nCome on, now! Let's go!\nYou're too slow! You drive like a woman!\n- Very nice. You see her?\n- Oh, my.\nVery pretty. Watch out, you goat!\nBreathe, breathe, breathe.\nAre you out of your mind?\n- What is wrong with you?\n- What's the matter, baby?\nYou don't like a good ride?\nAsshole!\nYou know, I know a few\ntechniques could help you\n- manage that anger very effectively.\n- You zip it. We're walking.\nOkay.\nExcuse me. Dr Sterns?\n- Yes.\n- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.\nOh! Dr Ross!\n- I have someone who'd like to meet you.\n- Okay.\nIt's Mr Blue, isn't it?\nMr Green?\nI got to tell you,\nI've been wondering if you were even real.\nAnd if you were, what would it look like?\nA person with that much\npower lurking in him.\nNothing could have surprised me more\nthan this unassuming man\nshaking my hand.\nBut, look. We're not strolling\ninto the park for a picnic, here.\nEven if everything goes perfectly,\nif we induce an episode,\nif we get the dosage exactly right,\nis that going to be a lasting cure\nor just some antidote to suppress\nthat specific flare-up?\nI don't know.\nWhat I'm saying is that if we overshoot this\nby even the smallest integer\nwe're dealing with concentrations\nwith extraordinary levels of toxicity.\n- You mean it could kill him.\n- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.\nYou should know that there's\na flip side to this, too.\nIf we miss on the low side,\nif we induce me and it fails,\nthis will be very dangerous for you.\nLook. I've always been\nmore curious than cautious,\nand that's served me pretty well.\nSo, are we going to do this?\nHow you feeling, man?\nLike a monster.\nOkay. On the table.\nThese will protect you from yourself\nif you have a strong reaction.\nYou can tell me later\nif you thought it was strong.\nOh, come on! Stupid graduate students.\nOkay...\nYou, you, you.\nThis will be a somewhat novel sensation.\nWe have begun.\nThe dialysis machine will mix the antidote\nwith your blood.\nExcept the antidote will only take hold\nonce we've achieved a full reaction.\nJust relax.\nOkay. We are comprehensive.\nHere you go.\nAll right. We set to pop?\nI'd take your hands off him.\nOh, my God!\nWait, wait! There's more! Wait!\n- Now. Okay, now!\n- Wait.\nNow, do it! Do it!\nBruce! Bruce, look at me.\nStay with me. The antidote, now!\nSterns, do it now!\nBruce, look at me. Look in my eyes.\nPlease, look in my eyes.\nOh, you've got to be kidding me!\nBruce.\nOh, my God.\nBruce? Bruce, can you hear me?\nBruce?\nIt's okay. You're okay. You're okay.\nYou did it.\nHe's fine. This is fantastic.\nIt's over.\nHi.\nHi.\nThat was the most extraordinary thing\nI have seen in my entire life!\nOkay, you know what? Stop, please.\nWe need to go back and talk\nabout what just happened in there.\nAbsolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse\ncame from the amygdala.\n- I think Dr Ross's primer...\n- Are you okay?\n...lets the cells absorb the energy\ntemporarily, and then it abates.\nThat's why you didn't die\nof radiation sickness years ago!\nNow, maybe we've neutralised\nthose cells permanently,\nor maybe we just suppressed that event.\nI'm inclined to think the latter,\nbut it's hard to know\nbecause none of our\ntest subjects ever survived.\n- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!\n- Wait, wait.\n- Wait, what did you just say?\n- They weren't getting\n- the myostatin primer...\n- No, no, no. Test subjects?\nWhat test subjects?\nCome with me.\n- What's the activity level?\n- Snipers are covering Alpha sector.\nWe started on rats and mice,\nbut it just completely fried them,\nso we had to go bigger.\nAnd we still don't know which is more toxic,\nthe gamma or your blood.\n- What do you mean, my blood?\n- Bruce, this is all you.\nYou didn't send me much to work with,\nso I had to concentrate it and make more.\nWith a little more trial and error,\nthere's no end to what we can do!\nThis is potentially Olympian!\nThis gamma technology\nhas limitless applications.\nWe'll unlock hundreds of cures.\nWe will make humans\nimpervious to disease!\nNo, no, we've got to destroy it.\n- Wait, what?\n- All of it.\nTonight. We're gonna incinerate it.\n- Is this the whole supply?\n- What...\nWe could get the Nobel for this!\nYou don't understand\nthe power of this thing.\nIt is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.\nAt your discretion, shooter.\nthree of us!\nThis is Promethean fire!\nIt's just...\nNo shot.\nBlonsky's going in.\nBlonsky, stand down.\nMy daughter's in there!\nWe have the antidote now.\nThey don't want the antidote!\nThey want to make it a weapon!\nAnd if we let it go, we will never get it back.\nYou don't know how powerful this thing is.\nI hate the government\njust as much as anyone,\nbut you're being a little paranoid,\ndon't you think?\nBruce! Bruce!\nGet out.\nWhere is it? Come on, where is it?\nShow him to me.\nBlonsky!\nMiss!\nTake this.\nIf you took it from me, I'm gonna\nput you in a hole for the rest of your life.\nBetty.\nI will never forgive what you've done to him.\nHe's a fugitive.\nYou made him a fugitive\nto cover your failures\nand to protect your career.\nDon't ever speak to me\nas your daughter again.\nIt's only because you're my daughter\nthat you're not in handcuffs, too.\nAre you telling me\nyou can make more like him?\nNo! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces,\nbut it's not like I can put together\nthe same Humpty Dumpty,\nif that's what you're asking.\nHe was a freak accident!\nThe goal is to do it better!\nSo Banner's the only...\n- She's an annoying bitch.\n- Why are you always hitting people?\nNow what possibly could I have done\nto deserve such aggression?\nIt's not what you've done.\nIt's what you're gonna do.\nI want what you got out of Banner.\nI want that.\nYou look like you've got a little\nsomething in you already, don't you?\nI want more.\nYou've seen what he becomes, right?\nI have.\nAnd it's beautiful.\nGodlike.\nWell, I want that.\nI need that. Make me that.\nI don't know what you've got\ninside you already.\nThe mix could be\nan abomination.\nI didn't say I was unwilling.\nI just need informed consent.\nAnd you've given it.\nThis is what I was trying to explain.\nI don't know what you've been\nladling into yourself.\nBut clearly it worked.\nLet's assume you don't understand\na word I'm saying,\nbut if you'll just get back on the table,\nI can fix this.\nShoot it!\n- Hey!\nNo!\nDelta 4 to Leader.\nThey took out two of our guys,\ntwo of our guys!\nBlonsky and the Major are still inside!\nCome on! Move, move, move, move!\nIt's over there!\nDrop them!\nWhat is that thing?\n- Shoot it!\nOkay. All right! You... You, drive!\nLet's go! Move, move!\nDelta 4 to Leader!\n- Go, go, go, go, go!\nSomething big\njust went off down here!\nGeneral, you should hear this!\nThe Hulk is in the street!\nI repeat, the Hulk is in the street!\nThat's impossible.\nYou get a hold of yourself, young man.\nYou get it together. What is your position?\nTurn us around.\nWe're going back. Why are we going back?\nDamn it! Give me eyes down there!\nYes, sir!\nWhat the hell was that?\nGo, go, go!\nNo!\nOne of yours?\nOh, my God. What have you done?\nFire at him, fire at him!\nDo you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?\nCome on!\nSweet.\nBooyah!\nGet out of there, soldier!\nStacy!\nGive me a real fight!\nSir?\nSir?\nTell them to bring everything they've got\nand head for Harlem.\nIt has to be me.\nYou have to take me back there.\nWhat are you saying?\nYou think you can control it?\nNo, no, not control it,\nbut, I don't know, maybe aim it.\nAnd what if you can't?\nWe made this thing.\nAll of us.\nPlease.\n- Land us near it.\n- No, no. No, keep us high.\nOpen the back door.\nBruce! Bruce, stop!\nStop! What are you doing?\nThink about this!\nYou don't even know if you'll change!\nYou don't have to do this!\nPlease, this is insane!\nBetty, I've got to try.\nI'm sorry.\nOh, shit!\n- Get her in here!\n- Come on, miss.\nThere. Betty!\nHulk!\nYeah!\nCome on!\nIs that all you've got?\nUse that thing, soldier! Give him some help!\nWhich one?\nHelp the green one, damn it!\nWhich one do you think?\nCut the other one in half!\nRoss!\nKeep it on him!\nLook, I got to put it down!\n- Hang on!\nDad?\nAre you hurt? Let me help you.\nI'm all right. Just find a way out.\nYou don't deserve this power!\nNow watch her die!\nLook out!\nAbomination: [About to kill Ross with a huge chain] General\u2026any last words?\nHulk: [rouses] HULK\u2026 SMASH!! [smashes the ground]\nStop!\nIt's okay.\nBetty.\n[General Ross sulks at a bar]\nGeneral Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: [Drinks shot] Reload. [barkeep gets another shot; Ross chugs the shot] Reload.\nShadowy Figure: [Approaches Ross] Mmmm, the smell of stale beer and defeat. Y'know, I hate to say \"I told you so,\" General, but that Super-Soldier program was put on ice for a reason. [Appears as Tony Stark] I've always felt that hardware was much more reliable.\nRoss: Stark.\nStark: General.\nRoss: You always wear such nice suits.\nStark: Touch\u00e9. I hear you have an unusual problem.\nRoss: You should talk.\nStark: You should listen. [the General leans in a bit as Stark whispers] What if I told you we were putting a team together?\nRoss: Who's \"we\"?\n[Stark clears his throat, looks at the General, and smiles.]\n\nMajor Kathleen \"Kat\" Sparr: Here's something interesting. Possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee. Man drank one of those guarana sodas\u2026guess it had a little more kick than he was looking for.\n[cut to a man opening his fridge, reaching for a soda, opening it and drinking]\nMilwaukee Man: Wow!\n[he starts choking and falls unconscious]\n\n\n[after Blonsky's mission to Brazil to recapture Banner goes awry]\nEmil Blonsky: Forgive me, sir, but\u2026doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there? Because he didn't lose us. And he was not alone, sir. We had him, but then something hit us. Something BIG hit us! It threw a forklift truck like it was a SOFTBALL! It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: Well, it's gone.\nBlonsky: Well, if Banner knows what it is, I'm gonna track him down, I'm gonna put my foot on his throat, and I'm gonna\u2014\nRoss: That was Banner. It was Banner.\nBlonsky: [understandably confused] You'll have to explain that, sir.\nRoss: No, I don't. You've done a good job. Pack up and get our men on a plane. We're going home.\n\n\n[Ross briefs Blonsky about Banner]\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: You must realize what I'm about to tell you is very sensitive, both to me and the Army. You know that we have a Bio-Force Department, and that we had a bio-force enhancement project developed during World War II.\nEmil Blonsky: A super-soldier.\nGen. Ross: A simplification, but yes. We decided to dust it off and give it another go, aiming to create a better soldier. Banner\u2019s work was very early phase. It wasn\u2019t even weapons application. He thought he was working on radiation resistance. I would never have told him what the project really was. But he was so sure of what he was onto, that he tested it on himself. And something went very wrong\u2026or it went very right. As far as I\u2019m concerned, that man\u2019s whole body is property of the U.S. Army.\nBlonsky: You said he wasn\u2019t working on weapons, right?\nRoss: No.\nBlonsky: But you were. You were, weren\u2019t you? You were trying other things.\nRoss: One serum we developed\u2026was very promising.\nBlonsky: So why did he run?\nRoss: He\u2019s a scientist. He is not one of us.\n\n\nBetty Ross: Bruce, I don't understand why we can't just walk in and talk to my father.\nBruce Banner: He told me what he was gonna do. He wants it out of me. He wants to dissect it so he can replicate it. He wants to make it a weapon.\n\n\nBetty: What is it like? When it happens, what do you experience?\nBruce: Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard? Those induced hallucinations? It\u2019s a lot like that, just a thousand times amplified. It\u2019s like someone poured a liter of acid into my brain.\nBetty: Do you remember anything?\nBruce: Just fragments. Images. There\u2019s too much noise, I can never derive anything out of it.\nBetty: But then, it\u2019s still you, inside of it\u2014\nBruce: No. No, it\u2019s not.\nBetty: I don\u2019t know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me. Maybe your mind is in there, it\u2019s just overcharged and can\u2019t process what\u2019s happening-\nBruce: I don\u2019t want to control it. I want to get rid of it.\n\n\n[after Blonsky has every bone in his body shattered during a fight with the Hulk]\nMajor Kathleen \"Kat\" Sparr: Sir, Blonsky\u2026\nGen.

Ross: He\u2019s a fugitive.\nBetty: You made him a fugitive. To cover your failures, and to protect your career. Don\u2019t ever speak to me as your daughter again.\nGen. Ross: It\u2019s only because you\u2019re my daughter that you\u2019re not in handcuffs too!\n\n\n[General Ross meets with Betty's boyfriend]\nGen. Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross: You did the right thing contacting us. Leonard, I need to know where they're going. She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.\nLeonard Samson: From who? He protected her, you almost killed her.\nRoss: I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.\nLeonard: You know, it's a point of professional pride for me that I can tell when somebody's lying. And you are. I don't know where he's going. I know she'll help him if she can.\nRoss: Then she's aiding a fugitive. And I can't help either one of them. [walks off]\nLeonard: I used to wonder why she never talked about you. Now I know.\nRoss: [to himself] Where does she meet these guys?\n\n\nMajor Kathleen \"Kat\" Sparr: Are you telling me you can make more like him?\nDr. Samuel Sterns: No, not yet! I've sorted out a few pieces, but it's not like I can put together the same Humpty Dumpty, if that's what you're asking. He was a freak accident, the goal is to do it better!\nSparr: So Banner was the only\u2014wait\u2014[Knocked unconscious]\nEmil Blonsky: Aah, she's an annoying bitch, isn't she?\nSterns: Why are you always hitting people?! [Blonsky pulls out his gun and points it at Dr. Sterns] Now what\u2026could I have possibly done\u2026to deserve such aggression?\nBlonsky: [mumbling agitatedly] It's not what you've done, it's what you're gonna do. [Dr. Sterns raises his head, interested] I want what you've got off Banner, I want that.\nSterns: [rising] You look like\u2026you've got a little something in you already, don't you?\nBlonsky: Yeah, well, I want more. You've seen what he becomes, right?\nSterns: I have\u2026and it's beautiful. Godlike.\nBlonsky: I want that\u2026I need that. Make me that.\nSterns: I don't know what you've got inside you already. The mixture could become\u2026an abomination. [Blonsky grabs Dr. Sterns by the collar and raises him into the air] I didn't say I was unwilling\u2026I just need informed consent\u2026and you've given it!\n\n\n[in New York City]\nBetty Ross: The subway is probably quickest.\nBruce Banner: Me? In a metal tube, deep underground with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world?\nBetty: \u2026right, let's get a cab.\n . . .\n[one very stressful cab ride later]\nBetty: [kicking the cab door as she gets out] Asshole!\nBruce: You know, I know a few techniques that could help you manage that anger effectively\u2014\nBetty: You zip it! We're walking.\nBruce: \u2026okay.\n\n\nAbomination: [About to kill Ross with a huge chain] General\u2026any last words?\nHulk: [rouses] HULK\u2026SMASH!! [smashes the ground]\n\n\n\n"

As he\nstands, he sees Groot dancing and looks at him, worried.\nQUILL\nGroot, look - !\nA TENTACLE FLIES IN FROM OFF-SCREEN, KNOCKING Quill OUT-OFFRAME as Groot dances on, blissfully unaware.\n\n\u00a9 Marvel\n\n\f6\nGroot, smiling, dances onward, as DRAX, in the clutches of a\ngiant tentacle, is SLAMMED NUMEROUS TIMES BESIDE HIM.\nGroot arrives at GAMORA, who is blasting at the OFF-SCREEN\nBEAST.\nGAMORA\nGet out of the way, Groot!

The bug FLIES crookedly away, one wing\nmulched.\nRocket JETS OFF back toward the battle, muttering:\nROCKET (CONT\u2019D)\nDisgusting.\nGroot sees something else and becomes furious. We follow his\nline of sight to a GRAZING ORLONI.\n\n\u00a9 Marvel\n\n\f7\nGroot SCREAMS A WAR CRY and ATTACKS IT. He GROWS HIS\nBRANCHES AROUND IT, and the terrified Orloni DARTS AWAY,\nDRAGGING GROOT WITH IT.\nGroot\u2019s anger becomes panic as he is DRAGGED AROUND BY THE\nORLONI and can\u2019t let go.\nThe Orloni DARTS around the power station and underneath the\nRAGING BATTLE, a CRYING Groot bouncing along behind it.\nFinally, he LETS GO and goes TUMBLING, ROLLING directly INTO\nTHE CAMERA.\nAnd then stands up and, as if none of it happened at all,\nstarts DANCING AGAIN.\nWe PAN and see the speakers and Walkman beside him, and we\nrealize Baby Groot has traveled around the entire Power\nStation and has arrived back where he started When Drax is FLUNG by the beast into the stereo system,\nSMASHING it.\nGroot stops dancing. Angry that Drax has ruined his fun, he\npicks up a piece of the stereo and beats him with it.\nCREDITS END.\nDrax stands and glares at the ferocious beast as Rocket,\nQuill, and Gamora BLAST at it without effect.\nDRAX\nThe beast\u2019s hide is too thick to be\npierced from the outside. I must\ncut through it from the inside.\nHuh?\n\nGAMORA\n\nDrax HOLLERS, CHARGING the creature.\nGAMORA (CONT\u2019D)\nDrax, no!

But they\u2019re worth thousands\nof units a piece. Which is why the\nSovereign hired us to protect them.\nRocket pulls out one of the ANULAX BATTERIES, checking it\nout.\nGamora, Drax, and Quill walk on. Rocket stays back a moment.\nQuill nods down the walkway, where GOLDEN SOVEREIGN CITIZENS\nstand at the edge of the station, gawking.\nQUILL (CONT\u2019D)\nJust be careful what you say around\nthese folks. They\u2019re easily\noffended and the cost of\ntransgression is death.\nDRAX\nSounds judgmental for a bunch of\ngolden morons.\nQUILL\nThat\u2019s the kind of thing you might\nwant to keep to yourself.\nGAMORA\nI\u2019ll hold my tongue, as long as\nthey deliver what was promised.\nEXT.

Hey, Forrest!\nSoldier: We can talk, sir.\nTony: Oh, I see. So it's personal?\nSoldier: (She's driving the Vehicle.) No, you intimidate them.\nTony: Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.\nSoldier: I'm an airman.\nTony: You have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?\n[The Soldiers in the vehicle laugh and chuckle.]\nTony: Come on, it's okay, laugh.\nSoldier:  Sir, I have a question to ask.\nTony: Yes, please.\nSoldier: Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?\nTony: That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?\n The Soldier next to him, Jimmy, raises his hand.\nTony: You're kidding me with the hand up, right?\nSoldier (Jimmy): Is it cool if I take a picture with you?\nTony: Yes. It's very cool.\n The soldier next to him pulls his camera out and hands it to the soldier in the front seat.\nTony: I don't want to see this on your MySpace page.\n The Soldier puts up a peace sign for the photo.\nTony: Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.\nSoldier (Jimmy): Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings.\n As the picture was about to be taken, something hit and blew up the vehicle in front of them. Gunshots and such were heard and hitting the side of their vehicle.\nTony: What's going on?\nSoldier: Contact left!\nTony: What have we got?\n The driver stepped out to go into combat and was shot down\nSoldier: Jimmy, stay with Stark!\nSoldier (Jimmy): Stay down!\nTony: Yeah.\n The other Soldier from the front seat got out to shoot but was shot too.\nSoldier (Jimmy): Son of a bitch!\n Jimmy got out to fight.\nTony: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!\nSoldier (Jimmy): Stay here!\n[Jimmy turned back around and he was gunned down too, holes piercing the vehicle. Tony's hearing and senses were dulled a bit as he got himself out of the vehicle, stumbling a bit in the chaos. He got some of his hearing back and ran and dove behind a rock for cover. He pulled out his phone to contact and call for help when a bomb landed next to him. He looked over to see it say: Stark Industries. He tried to get up and get away, but didn't in time. The bomb exploded and made him fly through the air a bit.\nTony: Whoa!\n[He hit the ground hard, senses dulled again. He felt a pain in his chest and pulled his shirt of out the way as blood started to pool.]\n[Scene change]\nVoice over: Tony Stark. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark's lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder, until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe.\nColonel James Rhodes: As liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark. Tony?\nObadiah: Thank you, Colonel.\n Rhodes: Thanks for the save.\nObadiah: This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much.\n  This is wonderful. Well, I'm not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He's always working.\n Scene change\nTony: Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.\n Rhodes: You are unbelievable.\nTony: Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?\n Rhodes: Nobody roped me into anything!\nTony: I'm so sorry.\n Rhodes: But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored.\nTony: Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So when do we do it?\nRhodes: It's right here. Here you go.\nTony: There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.\nRhodes: Yeah, it's okay.\nTony: Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around.\nWe're gonna let it ride!\nTony: Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.\n hot girl blows on dice\n  Okay, you, too.\n Tony holds the dice out to Rhodes.\n Rhodes: I don't blow on a man's dice.\n Tony: Come on, honey bear.\n Rhodes knocks Tony's hand away causing the dice to roll.\n  There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...\nDealer: Two craps. Line away.\nRhodes: That's what happens.\n Tony: Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, William.\n- This is where I exit.\n- All right.\nTomorrow, don't be late.\n- Yeah, you can count on it.\n- I'm serious!\nI know, I know.\nRender unto Caesar\nthat which is Caesar's. There you go.\nChristine Everhart: Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark! Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?\n- She's cute.\n- She's all right?\n- Hi.\n- Hi.\n- Yeah. Okay, go.\n- It's okay?\nChristine: You've been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?\n Tony: Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.\nChristine: And what do you say to your other nickname? \"The Merchant of Death\"?\n Tony: That's not bad.\n\nTony: Let me guess. Berkeley?\nChristine: Brown, actually.\n Tony: Well, Ms. Brown, it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.\nChristine: Rehearse that much?\nTony: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.\nChristine: I can see that.\n Tony: I'd like to show you first-hand.\nChristine: All I want is a serious answer.\nTony: Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, \"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.\"\nChristine: That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.\nTony: My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.\nChristine: And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.\nTony: Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.\nChristine: You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?\nTony: I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.\n[They have sex.]\nJarvis: Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.\nChristine: Tony?\n Hey, Tony?\nJarvis: You are not authorized to access this area.\n- Jesus.\nPepper Potts: That's Jarvis. He runs the house. I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.\nChristine: You must be the famous Pepper Potts.\nPepper Potts: Indeed I am.\nChristine: After all these years, Tony still has you\npicking up the dry-cleaning.\nPepper Potts: I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?\n\nGive me an exploded view.\n\nThe compression in cylinder three appears to be low.\n\nLog that.\n\n- I'm gonna try again, right now.\n- Please don't turn down my music.\n\nI'll keep you posted.\n\nYou are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.\n\n- How'd she take it?\n- Like a champ.\n\nWhy are you trying to hustle me out of here?\n\nYour flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.\n\nThat's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.\nTony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.\nDoesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?\n\nLarry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.\n\nDo you want it? Yes or no.\n\nIs it a good representation of his spring period?\n\nNo. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked, not \"spring\" like the season.\n- So?\n\nI think it's a fair example.\nI think it's incredibly overpriced.\n\nI need it. Buy it. Store it.\n\nOkay.\nThe MIT commencement speech...\n\nIs in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...\n\nThey're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.\n\nDeflect it and absorb it.\nDon't transmit it back to me.\n\nPepper: I need you to sign this\nbefore you get on the plane.\nTony: What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?\nPepper: As a matter of fact, I do.\n Tony: I don't like it when you have plans.\nPepper: I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.\n Tony: It's your birthday?\n Pepper: Yes.\n Tony: I knew that. Already?\n Pepper: Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.\n Tony: Get yourself something nice from me.\n Pepper: I already did.\nTony: And?\n Pepper: It was very nice.\nTony: Yeah.\n Pepper: Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.\nTony: You're welcome, Miss Potts.\n\nOkay.\n\nYou're good.\nI thought I lost you back there.\n\nYou did, sir.\nI had to cut across Mulholland.\n\nI got you. I got you.\n\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n- What?\n- Three hours.\n\nI got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.\n\nFor three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.\n\nWaiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.\n\nWheels up! Rock and roll!\n\n- What you reading, platypus?\n- Nothing.\n\nCome on, sour patch. Don't be mad.\n\nI told you, I'm not mad.\nI'm indifferent, okay?\n\n- I said I was sorry.\n- Good morning, Mr. Stark.\n\nYou don't need to apologize to me.\nI'm your man.\n\nHi. I told him I was sorry, but he...\n\n- I'm just indifferent right now.\n- Hot towel?\n\nYou don't respect yourself,\n\n- so I know you don't respect me.\n- I respect you.\n\nI'm just your babysitter.\n\nSo, when you need\nyour diaper changed... Thank you.\n\nLet me know\nand I'll get you a bottle, okay?\n\nHey! Heat up the sake, will you?\n\n- Thanks for reminding me.\n- No, I'm not talking...\n\nWe're not drinking.\nWe're working right now.\n\n- You can't have sashimi without sake.\n- You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.\n\nIt would be irresponsible not to drink.\nI'm just talking about a nightcap.\n\nHot sake?\n\n- Yes, two, please.\n- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.\n\nThat's what I'm talking about.\n\nWhen I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!\nHey, you know what?\nI'm not like you. I'm not cut out...\nNo, no. You don't have to be like me!\nBut you're more than what you are.\nCan you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?\nNo! You can't be distracted right now!\nListen to me!\nGeneral.\nWelcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward\nto your weapons presentation.\nThanks.\nTony Stark: Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon\nis one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it.\nAnd it's worked out pretty well so far.\nFind an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves. For your consideration, the Jericho. I'll be throwing one of these in with every purchase\nof 500 million or more. To peace!\n\nObadiah Stane: Tony.\nTony Stark: Obie, what are you doing up?\nI couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?\nTony Stark: It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.\nHey! Way to go, my boy!\nI'll see you tomorrow, yeah?\nWhy aren't you wearing those pajamas\nI got you?\nGood night, Tony.\n\n- Hey, Tony.\nTony Stark:  I'm sorry, this is the \"fun-vee.\" The \"hum-drum-vee\" is back there.\n- Nice job.\n- See you back at base.\n\nI wouldn't do that if I were you.\n\nWhat the hell did you do to me?\n\nWhat I did?\n\nWhat I did is to save your life.\n\nI removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see?\n\nI have a souvenir. Take a look.\n\nYinsen: I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.\n\n- What is this?\n- That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.\nThat's right. Smile.\n\nWe met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.\nTony Stark: I don't remember.\nNo, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.\n\nWhere are we?\n\nCome on, stand up. Stand up!\n\nJust do as I do.\n\nCome on, put your hands up.\n\nTony Stark: Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?\n\nDo you understand me? Do as I do.\n\nHe says, \"Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer \"in the history of America.\"\nHe is honored. He wants you to build the missile. The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.\nThis one.\nTony Stark:  refuse.\nTony!\nHe wants to know what you think.\nTony Stark: I think you got a lot of my weapons.\nHe says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials. He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free.\nTony Stark: No, he won't.\nNo, he won't. I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?\nTony Stark: Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.\nWell, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it?\nIf this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up.\nI need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.\nI need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.\nI would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.\n- How many languages do you speak?\n- A lot.\nBut apparently, not enough for this place.\nThey speak Arabic, Urdu,\nDari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.\nTony Stark: Who are these people?\nThey are your loyal customers, sir.\nThey call themselves the Ten Rings.\nYou know, we might be more productive\nif you include me in the planning process.\nOkay, we don't need this.\n\nWhat is that?\n\nThat's palladium, 0.15 grams.\n\nWe need at least 1.6, so why don't\nyou go break down the other 11?\n\nCareful.\nCareful, we only get one shot at this.\n\nRelax. I have steady hands.\n\nWhy do you think you're still alive?\n\n- What do I call you?\n- My name is Yinsen.\n\nYinsen. Nice to meet you.\n\nNice to meet you, too.\n\nThat doesn't look like a Jericho missile.\n\nTony Stark: That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one\npowering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel\nout of my heart.\nBut what could it generate?\nTony Stark: If my math is right, and it always is,\nthree gigajoules per second.\nThat could run your heart\nfor 50 lifetimes.\nTony Stark: Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.\n\n- This is our ticket out of here.\n- What is it?\n\nFlatten them out and look.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nImpressive.\n\nGood.\n\nGood roll. Good roll.\n\nTony Stark: You still haven't told me\nwhere you're from.\n\nI'm from a small town called Gulmira.\n\n- It's actually a nice place.\n- Got a family?\n\nYes, and I will see them\nwhen I leave here.\n\nAnd you, Stark?\n\n- No.\n- No?\n\nSo you're a man who has everything and nothing.\n\nRelax.\n\nThe bow and arrow once was the pinnacle\nof weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. An empire twice the size\nof Alexander the Great and four times\nthe size of the Roman Empire. But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn.\nWhat does he want?\n\nWhat do you want? A delivery date?\n\nI need him.\n\nGood assistant.\n\nYou have till tomorrow\nto assemble my missile.\n\nOkay? Can you move?\n\nOkay, say it again.\n\n41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,\n\nthat's from the door,\nfork right, 33 steps, turn right.\n\nYinsen! Yinsen! Stark!\n\nSay something.\nSay something back to him.\n\n- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...\n- Then speak Hungarian.\n\n- Okay. I know.\n- What do you know?\n\n- How'd that work?\n- Oh, my goodness.\n\n- It worked all right.\n- That's what I do.\n\n- Let me finish this.\n- Initialize the power sequence.\n\nOkay.\n\n- Now!\n- Tell me. Tell me.\n\nFunction 11.\nTell me when you see a progress bar.\n\n- It should be up right now.\n- Yes.\n\nTalk to me. Tell me when you see it.\n\n- I have it.\n- Press Control \"l\".\n\n- \"I.\" Got it.\n- \"I.\" \"Enter.\" \"l\" and \"Enter.\"\n\nCome over here and button me up.\n\nOkay. All right.\n\nEvery other hex bolt.\n\n- They're coming!\n- Nothing pretty, just get it done.\n\n- Just get it done.\n- They're coming.\n\nMake sure the checkpoints are clear\nbefore you follow me out, okay?\n\nWe need more time.\n\nHey,\n\n- I'm gonna go buy you some time.\n- Stick to the plan!\n\nStick to the plan!\n\nYinsen!\n\n- Yinsen!\n- Watch out!\n\nStark.\n\nCome on. We got to go.\n\nMove for me, come on. We got a plan.\nWe're gonna stick to it.\n\nThis was always the plan, Stark.\n\nCome on, you're gonna go\nsee your family. Get up.\n\nMy family is dead.\n\nI'm going to see them now, Stark.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nI want this. I want this.\n\nThank you for saving me.\n\nDon't waste it. Don't waste your life.\n\nMy turn.\n\nNot bad.\n\nHey!\n\nHow was the \"fun-vee\"?\n\nNext time, you ride with me, okay?\n\nWatch it, coming up here.\n\nAre you kidding me with this?\nGet rid of them.\n\nYour eyes are red.\nA few tears for your long-lost boss?\n\n- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.\n- Yeah, vacation's over.\n\nWhere to, sir?\n\n- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.\n- No.\n\nNo? Tony, you have to\n\n- go to the hospital.\n- No is a complete answer.\n\n- The doctor has to look at you.\n- I don't have to do anything.\n\nI've been in captivity for three months.\n\nThere are two things I want to do.\nI want an American cheeseburger,\n\n- and the other...\n- That's enough of that.\n\n...is not what you think. I want you\nto call for a press conference now.\n\n- Call for a press conference?\n- Yeah.\n\n- What on earth for?\n- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.\n\nLook at this!\n\nTony.\n\n- We were going to meet at the hospital.\n- No, I'm fine.\n\nLook at you!\n\n- You had to have a burger, yeah?\n- Well, come on.\n\n- You get me one of those?\n- There's only one left. I need it.\n\nHey, look who's here! Yeah!\n\n- Miss Potts?\n- Yes.\n\nCan I speak to you for a moment?\n\nI'm not part of the press conference,\nbut it's about to begin right now.\n\nI'm not a reporter.\n\nI'm agent Phil Coulson,\n\nwith the Strategic Homeland\nIntervention, Enforcement\n\nand Logistics Division.\n\n- That's quite a mouthful.\n- I know. We're working on it.\n\nYou know, we've been approached\nalready by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...\n\nWe're a separate division\nwith a more specific focus.\n\nWe need to debrief Mr. Stark\nabout the circumstances of his escape.\n\n- I'll put something in the book, shall I?\n- Thank you.\n\nHey, would it be all right\nif everyone sat down?\n\nWhy don't you just sit down?\nThat way you can see me, and I can...\n\nA little less formal and...\n\n- What's up with the love-in?\n- Don't look at me.\n\nI don't know what he's up to.\n\n- Good to see you.\n- Good to see you.\n\nI never got to say goodbye to Dad.\n\nI never got to say goodbye to my father.\n\nThere's questions\nthat I would have asked him.\n\nI would have asked him how he felt\nabout what this company did.\n\nIf he was conflicted,\nif he ever had doubts.\n\nOr maybe he was every inch the man\nwe all remember from the newsreels.\n\nI saw young Americans killed\n\nby the very weapons I created\nto defend them and protect them.\n\nAnd I saw\n\nthat I had become part of a system that\nis comfortable with zero accountability.\n\n- Mr. Stark!\n- Hey, Ben.\n\nWhat happened over there?\n\nI had my eyes opened.\nI came to realize that I have more\n\nto offer this world\nthan just making things that blow up.\n\nAnd that is why, effective immediately,\nI am shutting down\n\nthe weapons manufacturing division\nof Stark International\n\nuntil such a time as I can decide\nwhat the future of the company will be.\n\nI think we're gonna be selling\na lot of newspapers.\n\nWhat direction it should take,\none that I'm comfortable with\n\nand is consistent with the highest good\nfor this country, as well.\n\nWhat we should take away from this\nis that Tony's back!\n\nAnd he's healthier than ever.\n\nWe're going to have\na little internal discussion\n\nand we'll get back to you\nwith the follow-up.\n\n- Where is he?\n- He's inside.\n\nWell, that... That went well.\n\nDid I just paint a target\non the back of my head?\n\nYour head? What about my head?\n\nWhat do you think the over-under on\nthe stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?\n\n- Optimistically, 40 points.\n- At minimum.\n\nYep.\n\nTony, we're a weapons manufacturer.\n\nObie, I just don't want a body count\nto be our only legacy.\n\nThat's what we do. We're iron mongers.\nWe make weapons.\n\nIt's my name on the side of the building.\n\nAnd what we do\nkeeps the world from falling into chaos.\n\nNot based on what I saw.\n\nWe're not doing a good enough job.\n\nWe can do better.\nWe're gonna do something else.\n\nLike what?\nYou want us to make baby bottles?\n\nI think we should take another look\ninto arc reactor technology.\n\nCome on.\nThe arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!\n\nTony, come on. We built that thing\nto shut the hippies up!\n\n- It works.\n- Yeah, as a science project.\n\nThe arc was never cost effective.\nWe knew that before we built it.\n\nArc reactor technology,\nthat's a dead end, right?\n\nMaybe.\n\nAm I right? We haven't had\na breakthrough in that in what?\n\n- Thirty years.\n- That's what they say.\n\nCould you have a lousier poker face?\nJust tell me, who told you?\n\n- Never mind who told me. Show me.\n- It's Rhodey or Pepper.\n\n- I want to see it.\n- Okay, Rhodey.\n\n- Okay.\n- Okay?\n\nIt works.\n\nListen to me, Tony. We're a team.\nDo you understand?\n\nThere's nothing we can't do\nif we stick together,\n\nlike your father and I.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't give you\na heads-up, okay?\n\n- But if I had...\n- Tony.\n\nTony, no more of this\n\"ready, fire, aim\" business.\n\n- You understand me?\n- That was Dad's line.\n\nYou gotta let me handle this.\n\nWe're gonna have to play\na whole different kind of ball now.\n\nWe're going to have\nto take a lot of heat.\n\nI want you to promise me\nthat you're gonna lay low.\n\nStark Industries!\n\nI've got one recommendation!\nReady? Ready?\n\nSell, sell, sell!\n\nAbandon ship!\n\nDoes the Hindenburg ring any bells?\n\nLet me show you the new\nStark Industries business plan!\n\nLook, that's a weapons company\nthat doesn't make weapons!\n\nPepper. How big are your hands?\n\n- What?\n- How big are your hands?\n\n- I don't understand why...\n- Get down here. I need you.\n\nHey.\n\nLet's see them. Show me your hands.\n\nLet's see them.\n\nOh, wow. They are small.\nVery petite, indeed.\n\nI just need your help for a sec.\n\nOh, my God, is that the thing\nthat's keeping you alive?\n\nIt was. It is now an antique.\n\nThis is what will be keeping me alive\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\nI'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,\nand I just ran into a little speed bump.\n\n- Speed bump, what does that mean?\n- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.\n\nThere's an exposed wire\nunder this device.\n\nAnd it's contacting the socket wall\nand causing a little bit of a short.\n\nIt's fine.\n\n- What do you want me to do?\n- Put that on the table over there.\n\n- That is irrelevant.\n- Oh, my God!\n\nI want you to reach in, and you're just\ngonna gently lift the wire out.\n\n- Is it safe?\n- Yeah, it should be fine.\n\nIt's like Operation.\nYou just don't let it touch\n\nthe socket wall or it goes \"beep.\"\n\n- What do you mean, \"Operation\"?\n- It's just a game, never mind.\n\n- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.\n- Okay.\n\nYou know, I don't think\nthat I'm qualified to do this.\n\nNo, you're fine.\nYou're the most capable, qualified,\n\ntrustworthy person I've ever met.\nYou're gonna do great.\n\nIs it too much of a problem to ask?\n'Cause I'm...\n\n- Okay, okay.\n- I really need your help here.\n\nOkay.\n\nOh, there's pus!\n\nIt's not pus. It's an inorganic\nplasmic discharge from the device,\n\n- not from my body.\n- It smells!\n\nYeah, it does.\n\nThe copper wire.\nThe copper wire, you got it?\n\n- Okay, I got it! I got it!\n- Okay, you got it?\n\nNow, don't let it touch the sides\nwhen you're coming out!\n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n\nThat's what\nI was trying to tell you before.\n\nOkay, now make sure\nthat when you pull it out, you don't...\n\nThere's a magnet at the end of it!\nThat was it. You just pulled it out.\n\n- Oh, God!\n- Okay, I was not expecting...\n\n- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!\n- Okay, what do I do?\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nNothing,\nI'm just going into cardiac arrest\n\n'cause you yanked it out like a trout...\n\n- What? You said it was safe!\n- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.\n\n- You gotta switch it out really quick.\n- Okay. Okay.\n\n- Tony? It's going to be okay.\n- What?\n\n- Is it?\n- It's gonna be okay.\n\n- I'm gonna make this okay.\n- Let's hope.\n\nOkay, you're gonna attach that\nto the base plate. Make sure you...\n\nWas that so hard? That was fun, right?\nHere, I got it. I got it. Here.\n\nNice.\n\n- Are you okay?\n- Yeah, I feel great.\n\nYou okay?\n\nDon't ever, ever, ever,\n\never ask me to do\nanything like that ever again.\n\nI don't have anyone but you.\n\nAnyway...\n\n- What do you want me to do with this?\n- That?\n\nDestroy it.\n\nIncinerate it.\n\nYou don't want to keep it?\n\nPepper, I've been called many things.\n\"Nostalgic\" is not one of them.\n\n- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\n- That will be all, Miss Potts.\n\nHey, Butterfingers, come here.\n\nWhat's all this stuff\ndoing on top of my desk?\n\nThat's my phone,\nthat's a picture of me and my dad.\n\nRight there. In the garbage.\nAll that stuff.\n\nThe future of air combat.\nIs it manned or unmanned?\n\nI'll tell you, in my experience,\n\nno unmanned aerial vehicle\nwill ever trump a pilot's instinct,\n\nhis insight,\n\nthat ability to look\ninto a situation beyond the obvious\n\nand discern its outcome,\nor a pilot's judgment.\n\nColonel?\nWhy not a pilot without the plane?\n\nLook who fell out of the sky.\nMr. Tony Stark.\n\n- Hello, sir.\n- Speaking of manned or unmanned,\n\nyou gotta get him to tell you\nabout the time he guessed wrong\n\nat spring break.\nJust remember that, spring break, 1987.\n\n- That lovely lady you woke up with.\n- Don't do that!\n\n- What was his name?\n- Don't do that.\n\n- Was it lvan?\n- Don't do that.\n\nThey'll believe it. Don't do that.\n\n- Okay.\n- Don't do that.\n\n- Pleasure meeting you.\n- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.\n\n- I'm surprised.\n- Why?\n\nI swear, I didn't expect to see you\nwalking around so soon.\n\nI'm doing a little better than walking.\n\n- Really?\n- Yeah.\n\nRhodey, I'm working on something big.\n\nI came to talk to you.\nI want you to be a part of it.\n\nYou're about to make a whole\nlot of people around here real happy,\n\n'cause that little stunt\nat the press conference,\n\nthat was a doozy.\n\nThis is not for the military. I'm not...\nIt's different.\n\nWhat? You're a humanitarian now\nor something?\n\n- I need you to listen to me.\n- No.\n\nWhat you need is time\nto get your mind right.\n\n- I'm serious.\n- Okay.\n\nIt's nice seeing you, Tony.\n\nThanks.\n\n- Jarvis, you up?\n- For you, sir, always.\n\nI'd like to open a new project file,\nindex as Mark Two.\n\nShall I store this on\nthe Stark Industries Central Database?\n\nActually, I don't know\nwho to trust right now.\n\nTill further notice, why don't we just\nkeep everything on my private server?\n\nWorking on a secret project,\nare we, sir?\n\nI don't want this winding up\nin the wrong hands.\n\nMaybe in mine,\nit can actually do some good.\n\nNext. Up.\n\nNot in the boot, Dummy. Right here.\nYou got me?\n\nStay put. Nice.\n\nYou're of no benefit at all.\nMove down to the toe. I got this.\n\nOkay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?\n\nUp.\n\nScrew it. Don't even move.\n\nYou are a tragedy.\n\nOkay, let's do this right.\n\nStart mark, half a meter,\nand back and center.\n\nDummy, look alive.\nYou're on standby for fire safety.\n\nYou, roll it.\n\nOkay. Activate hand controls.\n\nWe're gonna start off nice and easy.\n\nWe're gonna see if\n10% thrust capacity achieves lift.\n\nAnd three,\n\ntwo,\n\none.\n\nUp two. All right, set that.\n\nI've been buzzing you.\nDid you hear the intercom?\n\nYeah, everything's... What?\n\n- Obadiah's upstairs.\n- Great!\n\n- What would you like me to tell him?\n- Great. I'll be right up.\n\nOkay.\n\nI thought you said\nyou were done making weapons.\n\nIt is.\n\nThis is a flight stabilizer.\nIt's completely harmless.\n\nI didn't expect that.\n\nHow'd it go?\n\nIt went that bad, huh?\n\nJust because I brought pizza\nback from New York\n\n- doesn't mean it went bad.\n- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.\n\nIt would have gone better\nif you were there.\n\nYou told me to lay low.\nThat's what I've been doing.\n\n- I lay low, and you take care of all...\n- Hey, come on. In public. The press.\n\n- This was a board of directors meeting.\n- This was a board of directors meeting?\n\nThe board is claiming\nyou have posttraumatic stress.\n\nThey're filing an injunction.\n\n- A what?\n- They want to lock you out.\n\nWhy, 'cause the stocks\ndipped 40 points?\n\nWe knew that was gonna happen.\n\n- Fifty-six and a half.\n- It doesn't matter.\n\nWe own the controlling interest\nin the company.\n\nTony, the board has rights, too.\n\nThey're making the case\nthat you and your new direction\n\n- isn't in the company's best interest.\n- I'm being responsible!\n\nThat's a new direction for me,\nfor the company.\n\nI mean, me on the company's behalf\nbeing responsible for the way that...\n\nThis is great.\n\n- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.\n- I'll be in the shop.\n\nHey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.\n\nI'm trying to turn this thing around,\nbut you gotta give me something.\n\nSomething to pitch them.\n\nLet me have the engineers analyze that.\nYou know, draw up some specs.\n\n- No. No, absolutely not.\n- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys\n\n- in New York!\n- This one stays with me.\n\n- That's it, Obie. Forget it.\n- All right, well, this stays with me, then.\n\nGo on, here, you can have a piece.\n\n- Take two.\n- Thank you.\n\nYou mind if I come down there\nand see what you're doing?\n\nGood night, Obie.\n\nDay 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.\nFor lack of a better option,\n\nDummy is still on fire safety.\nIf you douse me again,\n\nand I'm not on fire,\nI'm donating you to a city college.\n\nAll right, nice and easy.\n\nSeriously, just gonna start off\nwith 1% thrust capacity.\n\nAnd three, two, one.\n\nOkay.\n\nPlease don't follow me around\nwith it, either,\n\n'cause I feel like I'm gonna\ncatch on fire spontaneously.\n\nJust stand down!\nIf something happens, then come in.\n\nAnd again, let's bring it up to 2.5.\n\nThree, two, one.\n\nOkay, this is where I don't want to be!\n\nNot the car, not the car!\n\nTable!\n\nCould be worse! Could be worse!\nWe're fine! Okay.\n\nNo!\n\nYeah, I can fly.\n\n- Jarvis, are you there?\n- At your service, sir.\n\n- Engage Heads Up Display.\n- Check.\n\nImport all preferences\nfrom home interface.\n\nWill do, sir.\n\nAll right, what do you say?\n\nI have indeed been uploaded, sir.\nWe're online and ready.\n\nCan we start the virtual walk-around?\n\nImporting preferences\nand calibrating virtual environment.\n\nDo a check on control surfaces.\n\nAs you wish.\n\nTest complete. Preparing to\npower down and begin diagnostics.\n\nYeah. Tell you what.\nDo a weather and ATC check.\n\nStart listening in on ground control.\n\nSir, there are still terabytes\n\nof calculations needed\nbefore an actual flight is...\n\nJarvis! Sometimes you got to run\nbefore you can walk.\n\nReady? In three, two, one.\n\nHandles like a dream.\n\nAll right, let's see what\nthis thing can do.\n\nWhat's SR-71's record?\n\nThe altitude record for fixed wing flight\nis 85,000 feet, sir.\n\nRecords are made to be broken!\nCome on!\n\nSir, there is a potentially fatal\nbuildup of ice occurring.\n\nKeep going!\n\nHigher!\n\nWe iced up, Jarvis!\nDeploy flaps! Jarvis!\n\nCome on, we got to break the ice!\n\nKill power.\n\nNotes. Main transducer feels sluggish\nat plus 40 altitude.\n\nHull pressurization is problematic.\nI'm thinking icing is the probable factor.\n\nA very astute observation, sir.\n\nPerhaps, if you intend\nto visit other planets,\n\nwe should improve the exosystems.\n\nConnect to the sys. co.\nHave it reconfigure the shell metals.\n\nUse the gold titanium alloy from\nthe seraphim tactical satellite.\n\nThat should ensure a fuselage integrity\nwhile maintaining power-to-weight ratio.\n\n- Got it?\n- Yes.\n\nShall I render\nusing proposed specifications?\n\nThrill me.\n\nTonight's red-hot red carpet is right\nhere at the Disney Concert Hall,\n\nwhere Tony Stark's third annual benefit\nfor the Firefighter's Family Fund\n\nhas become the place to be\nfor L.A.'s high society.\n\nJarvis, we get an invite for that?\n\nI have no record of an invitation, sir.\n\n... hasn't been seen in public\n\nsince his bizarre and highly\ncontroversial press conference.\n\nSome claim he's suffering\nfrom posttraumatic stress\n\nand has been bedridden for weeks.\nWhatever the case may be,\n\nno one expects an appearance\nfrom him tonight.\n\nThe render is complete.\n\nA little ostentatious, don't you think?\n\nWhat was I thinking?\nYou're usually so discreet.\n\nTell you what.\nThrow a little hot-rod red in there.\n\nYes, that should help you\nkeep a low profile.\n\nThe render is complete.\n\nHey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.\n\nCommencing automated assembly.\n\nEstimated completion time is five hours.\n\nDon't wait up for me, honey.\n\nWeapons manufacturing is only\none small part of what Stark Industries\n\nis all about, and our partnership\nwith the fire and rescue community...\n\n- Hey, Tony, remember me?\n- Sure don't.\n\nYou look great, Hef.\n\nWe're going to have a great quarter.\n\nWhat's the world coming to when\na guy's got to crash his own party?\n\nLook at you. Hey, what a surprise.\n\nI'll see you inside.\n\nHey. Listen, take it slow, all right?\n\nI think I got the board\nright where we want them.\n\nYou got it. Just cabin fever.\nI'll just be a minute.\n\n- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.\n- Mr. Stark?\n\n- Yeah?\n- Agent Coulson.\n\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nThe guy from the...\n\nStrategic Homeland Intervention,\nEnforcement and Logistics Division.\n\nGod, you need a new name for that.\n\nYeah, I hear that a lot.\n\nListen, I know this must be a trying time\nfor you, but we need to debrief you.\n\nThere's still\na lot of unanswered questions,\n\nand time can be a factor\nwith these things.\n\nLet's just put something on the books.\n\nHow about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.\nat Stark Industries?\n\nTell you what.\nYou got it. You're absolutely right.\n\nWell, I'm going to go to my assistant,\nand we'll make a date.\n\nYou look fantastic!\nI didn't recognize you.\n\n- What are you doing here?\n- Just avoiding government agents.\n\n- Are you by yourself?\n- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?\n\n- Oh, it was a birthday present.\n- That's great.\n\n- From you, actually.\n- Well, I got great taste.\n\nYes.\n\n- You want to dance?\n- Oh, no.\n\n- All right, come on.\n- Thank you. No.\n\nAm I making you uncomfortable?\n\nNo. No. I always forget to wear\ndeodorant and dance with my boss\n\nin front of everyone that I work with\nin a dress with no back.\n\n- You look great and you smell great.\n- Oh, God.\n\nBut I could fire you if that would\ntake the edge off.\n\nI actually don't think that\nyou could tie your shoes without me.\n\n- I'd make it a week. Sure.\n- Really?\n\nWhat's your Social Security number?\n\n- Five.\n- Five?\n\n- Right.\n- Right.\n\nYou're missing just\na couple of digits there.\n\nThe other eight?\nSo I got you for the other eight.\n\n- How about a little air?\n- Yes, I need some air.\n\n- That was totally weird.\n- Totally harmless.\n\nIt was totally not harmless, by the way.\n\nWe're dancing. No one's even watching.\n\nEverybody who I work with...\nNo, you know why?\n\nI think you lost objectivity. I think\nthey just... People... We just danced.\n\nNo, it was not just a dance. You don't\nunderstand because you're you.\n\nAnd everybody knows\nexactly who you are\n\nand how you are with girls\nand all of that, which is completely fine.\n\nBut, you know, then me, you're my boss,\n\n- and I'm dancing with you.\n- I don't think it was taken that way.\n\nBecause it makes me look like\nthe one who's trying to...\n\n- I just think you're overstating it.\n- You know, and we're here,\n\nand then I'm wearing this ridiculous\n\ndress, and then we were dancing\nlike that and...\n\n- I would like a drink, please.\n- Got it, okay.\n\n- I would like a vodka martini, please.\n- Okay.\n\nVery dry with olives, a lot of olives.\nLike, at least three olives.\n\nTwo vodka martinis, extra dry,\nextra olives, extra fast.\n\nMake one of them dirty, will you?\n\nWow. Tony Stark.\n\n- Oh, hey.\n- Fancy seeing you here.\n\n- Carrie.\n- Christine.\n\n- Carrie.\n- Christine.\n\nThat's right.\n\nYou have a lot of nerve\nshowing up here tonight.\n\nCan I at least get a reaction from you?\n\nPanic. I would say panic is my reaction.\n\n'Cause I was referring\nto your company's\n\ninvolvement in this latest atrocity.\n\nYeah. They just put my name on the\ninvitation. I don't know what to tell you.\n\nI actually almost bought it,\nhook, line and sinker.\n\nI was out of town for a couple months,\nin case you didn't hear.\n\nIs this what you call accountability?\n\nIt's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?\n\n- When were these taken?\n- Yesterday.\n\n- I didn't approve any shipment.\n- Well, your company did.\n\nWell, I'm not my company.\n\n- Please, do you mind?\n- Have you seen these pictures?\n\n- What's going on in Gulmira?\n- Tony, Tony.\n\n- You can't afford to be this naive.\n- You know what?

Sir, we've explored\n\nwhat you've asked us, and it seems\nas though there's a little hiccup.\n\n- Actually...\n- A hiccup?\n\nYes, to power the suit, sir,\nthe technology actually doesn't exist.\n\n- So it's...\n- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?\n\nWilliam, here is the technology.\nI've asked you to simply make it smaller.\n\nOkay, sir, and that's what we're trying\nto do, but honestly, it's impossible.\n\nTony Stark was able to build this\nin a cave! With a box of scraps!\n\nWell, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.\n\nTony?\n\nTony, are you there? Hello?\n\nBreathe.\n\nEasy, easy.\n\nYou remember this one, right?\n\nIt's a shame the government\ndidn't approve it.\n\nThere's so many applications\nfor causing short-term paralysis.\n\nTony.\n\nWhen I ordered the hit on you,\n\nI worried that I was\n\nkilling the golden goose.\n\nBut, you see, it was just\n\nfate that you survived that.\n\nYou had one last golden egg to give.\n\nDo you really think that just because\nyou have an idea, it belongs to you?\n\nYour father, he helped give us\nthe atomic bomb.\n\nNow, what kind of world would it be\ntoday if he was as selfish as you?\n\nOh, it's beautiful.\n\nTony, this is your Ninth Symphony.\n\nWhat a masterpiece. Look at that.\n\nThis is your legacy.\n\nA new generation of weapons\nwith this at its heart.\n\nWeapons that will help steer the world\nback on course,\n\nput the balance of power in our hands.\n\nThe right hands.\n\nI wish you could've seen my prototype.\n\nIt's not as...\n\nWell, not as conservative as yours.\n\nToo bad you had to involve Pepper\nin this.\n\nI would have preferred that she lived.\n\nWhat do you mean,\nhe paid to have Tony killed?\n\nPepper, slow down.\nWhy would Obadiah...\n\nOkay, where's Tony now?\n\nI don't know.\nHe's not answering his phone.\n\nPlease go over there\nand make sure everything's okay.\n\nThank you, Rhodey.

She's with five agents.\n\nThey're about to arrest Obadiah.\n\nThat's not going to be enough.\n\nSection 16. Section 16. There it is.\n\nMy key's not working.\nIt's not opening the door.\n\nOh, wow! What's that?\nIt's, like, a little device?\n\nIt's, like, a thing that's going\nto pick the lock?\n\nYou might want to take\na few steps back.\n\nThat's the coolest thing I've ever seen.\n\nNot bad, huh? Let's do it.\n\nYou need me to do anything else?\n\nKeep the skies clear.\n\nDamn!\n\nNext time, baby.\n\nLooks like you were right.\nHe was building a suit.\n\nI thought it'd be bigger.\n\nHow do you think the Mark One\nchest piece is going to hold up?\n\nThe suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.\n\nThat chest piece\nwas never designed for sustained flight.\n\nKeep me posted.\n\nPepper!\n\n- Tony! Tony, are you okay?\n- I'm fine. How are...\n\n- Obadiah, he's gone insane!\n- I know.\n\n- Listen, you'd better get out of there.\n- He built a suit.\n\nGet out of there right now!\n\nWhere do you think you're going?\n\nYour services are no longer required.\n\nStane!\n\nI love this suit!\n\n- Put them down!\n- Collateral damage, Tony.\n\nDivert power to chest RT.\n\nPower reduced to 19%.\n\nLady!\n\nNo, no, no, no, no, no!\n\nFor 30 years, I've been holding you up!\n\nI built this company from nothing!\n\nNothing is going to stand in my way.\n\nLeast of all you!\n\nImpressive!\nYou've upgraded your armor!\n\nI've made some upgrades of my own!\n\nSir, it appears that his suit can fly.\n\nDuly noted.\nTake me to maximum altitude.\n\nWith only 15% power,\nthe odds of reaching that...\n\nI know the math! Do it!\n\nSir, you're not going to believe this.\nThat thing is back.\n\nGet me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!\n\nNot necessary, people.\nJust a training exercise.\n\nYes, sir.\n\n- Thirteen percent power, sir.\n- Climb!\n\n- Eleven percent.\n- Keep going!\n\n- Seven percent power.\n- Just leave it on the screen!\n\nStop telling me!\n\nYou had a great idea, Tony, but my\nsuit is more advanced in every way!\n\nHow'd you solve the icing problem?\n\nIcing problem?\n\nMight want to look into it.\n\nTwo percent.\n\nWe are now running\non emergency backup power.\n\n- Potts!\n- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?\n\nI'm almost out of power. I've got to get\nout of this thing. I'll be right there.\n\nNice try!\n\n- Weapons status?\n- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.\n\nFlares!\n\nVery clever, Tony.\n\n- Potts?\n- Tony!\n\nThis isn't working.\n\nWe're going to have to overload\nthe reactor and blast the roof.\n\n- Well, how are you going to do that?\n- You're going to do it.\n\nGo to the central console,\nopen up all the circuits.\n\nWhen I get clear of the roof,\nI'll let you know.\n\nYou're going to hit\nthe master bypass button.\n\nIt's going to fry everything up here.\n\nOkay. I'm going in now.\n\nMake sure you wait till I clear the roof.\nI'll buy you some time.\n\nThis looks important!\n\nI never had a taste for this sort of thing,\n\nbut I must admit,\nI'm deeply enjoying the suit!\n\nYou finally outdid yourself, Tony!\n\nYou'd have made your father proud!\n\nIt's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!\n\nTony!\n\nHow ironic, Tony!\n\nTrying to rid the world of weapons,\nyou gave it its best one ever!\n\n- Pepper!\n- And now I'm going to kill you with it!\n\n- You ripped out my targeting system!\n- Time to hit the button!\n\n- You told me not to!\n- Hold still, you little prick!\n\n- Just do it!\n- You'll die!\n\nPush it!\n\nTony!\n\nYou've all received the official\nstatement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night.\n\nThere have been unconfirmed reports\nthat a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor.\n\nFortunately, a member\nof Tony Stark's personal security staff...\n\n\"Iron Man.\" That's kind of catchy.\nIt's got a nice ring to it.\n\nI mean, it's not technically accurate.\nThe suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative,\nthe imagery, anyway.\n\nHere's your alibi.\n\nOkay.\n\n- You were on your yacht.\n- Yeah.\n\nWe have port papers that put you\nin Avalon all night, and sworn statements\nfrom 50 of your guests.\n\nSee, I was thinking maybe we should\nsay it was just Pepper and me alone on the island.\n\n- That's what happened.\n- All right.\n\nJust read it, word for word.\n\nThere's nothing about Stane here.\n\nThat's being handled. He's on vacation.\n\nSmall aircraft have\nsuch a poor safety record.\n\nBut what about the whole cover story\nthat it's a bodyguard?\n\nHe's my... I mean, is that...\nThat's kind of flimsy, don't you think?\n\nThis isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.\n\nJust stick to the official statement,\nand soon, this will all be behind you.\n\nYou've got 90 seconds.\n\nAgent Coulson?\n\nI just wanted to say thank you very much\nfor all of your help.\n\nThat's what we do.\nYou'll be hearing from us.\n\n- From the Strategic Homeland...\n- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nRight.\n\n- Let's get this show on the road.\n- You know, it's actually not that bad.\n\nEven I don't think I'm Iron Man.\n\n- You're not Iron Man.\nTony:  Am so.\nYou're not.\nTony:  All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have\nthis girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always\nbe worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted,\nwhich would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night.\nWhat night?\nYou know.\nAre you talking about the night that\nwe danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs\nto get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you're talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?\nTony: Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.\n\nAnd now, Mr. Stark has\nprepared a statement.\n\nHe will not be taking any questions.\nTony: Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was\ninvolved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...\nI'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you\nhonestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you...\nTony: I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official\nstory, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations,\nor insinuate that I'm a superhero.\nI never said you were a superhero.\nTony: Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.\u00a0\n- Just stick to the cards, man.\nTony: Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.\n[After end-credits. Tony reaches home]\nTony: Jarvis!\n[distorted] Welcome home, Sir. [Jarvis cuts out]\nNick Fury: \"I am Iron Man.\" You think you're\nthe only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part\nof a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.\nTony: Who the hell are you?\nNick Fury: [appears in light] Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.\nTony: [nonchalantly] Ah.\nNick Fury: I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.\n"

[Begins to hook the patient up to devices.] Image status, STAT.\nDr. Stephen Strange: We do not have time for that.\nChristine Palmer: You can\u2019t do it freehand.\nDoctor Strange: I can and I will.\nDr. West: This isn\u2019t the time for showing off, Strange.\nDoctor Strange: How about 10 minutes ago, when you called the wrong time of death? [Selects a pair of bent scissors and inspects the patient's brain on a screen.] Cranial nerves intact. [He artfully reaches into the brian with the thin scissors. There is a loud ticking noise coming from Dr. west's watch. He doesn't look away from the patient.] Dr. West, cover your watch.\n[Dr. West slides a hand over his expensive watch. Back to Stephen Strange, who is delicately performing the surgery's. His steady hand reaches in, and the scissors clasp around the billet. He slowly draws out th scissors and opens them, dropping the all blue bullet into a tray. It's out. Cheers fill the room.]\n\n\n\n\n[Doctor Palmer and Doctor Strange walk down the hospital hallway, talking to each other.]\nChristine Palmer: You know, you didn\u2019t have to humiliate him in front of everyone.\nDoctor Strange: I didn\u2019t have to save his patient either. [He dances slightly as when walks.] But, you know, sometimes I just can\u2019t help myself.\nChristine Palmer: Nick is a great doctor.\nDoctor Strange: You came to me.\nChristine Palmer: Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.\nDoctor Strange: You had a second opinion. What you needed was a competent one.\nChristine Palmer: Well, all the more reason you should be my neurosurgeon on call. You could make such a difference.\nDr. Stephen Strange: I can\u2019t work in your butcher shop.\nChristine Palmer: [slightly offended] Hey! Look, he\u2026\nDoctor Strange: Look, I\u2019m fusing transected spinal cords. I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system. The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come. In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.\nChristine Palmer: Yeah, you\u2019re right. In the ER, you\u2019re only saving lives. There\u2019s no fame, there\u2019s no CNN interviews\u2026 Well, I guess I\u2019ll have to stick with Nick.\nDoctor Strange: Wait a minute. You\u2019re not\u2026you guys aren\u2019t\u2026\nChristine Palmer: What?\nDoctor Strange: Sleeping together. Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.\nCrhstine Palmer: Explicit, actually. And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.\nDoctor Strange: Oh really?\n[They come to a stop outside of Christine's post.]\nChristine Palmer: I call it the Strange policy.\nDoctor Strange: Oh, good! I\u2019m glad something is named after me. You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure, and yet, somehow, no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique.\nChristine Palmer: We invented that technique.\nDoctor Strange: You know, I gotta say, I\u2019m very flattered by your policy. Look, I\u2019m talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.\nChristine Palmer: Another speaking engagement? So romantic.\nDoctor Strange: You used to love going to those things with me. We had fun together.\nChristine Palmer: No. You had fun. They weren\u2019t about us, they were about you.\nDoctor Strange: Not only about me.\nChristine Palmer: Stephen. Everything is about you.\nDoctor Strange: Maybe we can hyphenate. Strange-Palmer technique. \nChristine Palmer: [She walks as away, but looks back over her shoulder, grinning.] Palmer-Strange.\n[He grins too. he's gotten her.]\n\n\n\n\n[We see a fancy, expensive apartment--huge windows looking out on a beautiful city, and Doctor Strange walks in front of the windows, arrogance in his step. Switch scenes to show him pulling open a drawer full of twenty or so watches, rotating on their display. He wonders for a moment and then picks an especially expensive looking one. Switch setting to show him driving recklessly out of his apartment building's driveway in an expensive car. Later, on the road, he is still driving just as recklessly, but in the rainy darkness.]\nDoctor Strange: [To Billy, on the phone.] Billy! What have you got for me?\nBilly: I\u2019ve got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel. Crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor. Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture.\nDoctor Strange: Well, I could help, but so can 50 other people. Find me something worth my time.\nBilly: I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma.\nDoctor Strange: Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record? Definitely not.\nBilly: How about a 22-year-old female with an electronic implant in her brain to control schizophrenia struck by lightning?\n\nDoctor Strange: That does sound interesting. Could you send me the\u2026 [His phone screen lights up with the patient's documents] got it. Hey.\n\n[Another car appears on the road. Doctor Strange swerves out of the way and goes off the road, off the side of a mountain. The car crashes, Stephen blacks out]\nChristine Palmer: [Stephen wakes up in a hospital bed and see his hands in traction. Christine is next to his bed.] It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s going to be okay.\nDoctor Strange: [hoarsely]What did they do?\nChristine Palmer: They rushed you in a chopper. But it took a little while to find you. Golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car.\nDoctor Strange: What did they do?!?\nChristine Palmer: 11 stainless steel pins in the bones. Multiple torn ligaments. Severe nerve damage in both hands. You were on the table for 11 hours.\nDoctor Strange: Look at these fixators.\nChristine Palmer: No one could have done better.\nDoctor Strange: I could have done better.\nChristine Palmer: No. No.\n\n[A scene later in time. All Stephen's wounds are gone, except for the shaking in his ruined hands.]\nDoctor: Give your body time to heal.\nDoctor Strange: You ruined me. How long until I\u2019m\u2026\n\n[Doctor Strange's apartment, where a team of doctors are gathered around his table.]\nDoctor One: Doctor Strange\u2026 those tissues are still healing.\nDoctor Strange: So speed it up. Pass the stent under the brachial artery under the radial artery.\nDoctor Two: It\u2019s possible. Experimental and expensive, but possible.\nDoctor Strange: All I need is possible.\n\n[Doctor Strange has metal around his hand, pulling his fingers in, and he is excercising his weak hands by trying to fight against them. He is being supervised by a young doctor.] \nYoung Doctor: Up. Up. Show me your strength.\n[Doctor Strange groans in frustration, and his hands close.]\nDoctor Stephen Strange: Ah! It\u2019s useless.\nYoung Doctor: It\u2019s not useless, man, you can do this.\nDoctor Strange: [He tries again, but he's annoyed. And still arrogan.] Then answer me this, bachelor\u2019s degree. Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage this severe to do this, and actually recover?\nYoung Doctor: One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away. He had pain in his shoulder from the wheelchair. He came in 3 times a week. But one day he stopped coming. I thought he was dead. A few years later, he walked past me on the street.\nDoctor Strange: He walked? \nYoung Doctor: Yeah, he walked.\nDoctor Strange: Bullshit. Show me his file.\nYoung Doctor: It can take me a while to pull the files from the archive. But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong, it\u2019s worth it.\n\n[Dr. Strange is having a conversation with an elite doctor through his tablet. As he does so, right particles writing his name with his trembling hand.]\nEtienne: I looked at all your research. I read all the papers you\u2019ve sent, but\u2026 none will work. I\u2026 I don\u2019t think you realize how severe the damage is, I\u2026\nDoctor Strange: Look, here\u2019s the thing, I\u2026\nEtienne: At best, I\u2019d try and fail. Look, I understand. Here\u2019s the thing. I\u2026 What you want from me is impossible, Stephen.\nDoctor Strange Come on\u2026\nEtienne: I\u2019ve got my own reputation to consider.\nDoctor Strange: Etienne, wait.\nEtienne:I can\u2019t help you\u2026\nDoctor Strange: No. No, no, wait!\n[Too late. Etienne hangs up. Doctor Strange yells in frustration and knocks the tablet and the papers he's been practicing on off of the table. He sits there a moment, defeated, before the door opens and Christine walks in.]\nChristine Palmer: Hi. [Seeing his face.] He won\u2019t do it.\nDoctor Strange: He\u2019s a hack. There\u2019s a new procedure in Tokyo. They culture donor stem cells and then harvest them and 3D-print a scaffold. If I could get a loan together, just\u2026\nChristine Palmer: Stephen\u2026\nDoctor Strange: A small loan, 200,000.\nChristine Palmer: Stephen. You\u2019ve always spent money as fast as you could make it but now you\u2019re spending money you don\u2019t even have. Maybe it\u2019s time to consider stopping.\nDr. Stephen Strange: No. Now is exactly the time not to stop. Because, you see, I\u2019m not getting any better! [He goldsmith up his shaking hands angrily.]\nChristine Palmer: But this isn\u2019t medicine anymore. This is mania. Some things just can\u2019t be fixed.\nDoctor Strange: Life without my work\u2026\nChristine Palmer: Is still life. This isn\u2019t the end. There are other things that can give your life meaning.\nDoctor Strange:[Spitefully]Like what? Like you?\nChristine Palmer: And this is the part where you apologize.\nDoctor Strange: This is the part where you leave.\nChristine Palmer: Fine. I can\u2019t watch you do this to yourself anymore. [She move soon to leave.]\nDoctor Strange: Too difficult for you, is it?\nChristine Palmer: Yes. It is. And it breaks my heart to see you this way. \nDoctor Strange: No. Don\u2019t pity me.\nChristine Palmer: I\u2019m not pitying you.\nDoctor Strange: Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here? Bringing cheese and wine as if we\u2019re old friends going for a picnic? We are not friends, Christine. We were barely lovers. You just love a sob story, don\u2019t you? Is that what I am to you now? Poor Stephen Strange, charity case. He finally needs me. Another dregmof humanity for you to work on. Fix him up and send him back into the world, heart is just humming\u2026 [Shouting] You care so much, don't you?!?\nChristine Palmer: Goodbye, Stephen. [She drops her keys to his apartment on the the table and stalks out. He stared out ant the city, his hands still shaking. Zoom in on the paper on the floor, where writing out his name. The lines are shaky, incomplete, and illegible.]\n\n[Doctor Strange sifts through medical files with his trembling hands. He finds a couple of files with a post-it notebook on it that reads \"Told you so!\"\n\n[A basketball court, with men playing basketball and shouting at each other. Is Doctor Strange's jealous of how carefree and active they are?]\nMan 1: Come on, man! Where is the competition?\nMan 2: You talk a lot!\n[One then a walks over to the edge of the four court to a drink  of water even water. Doctor Strange approaches him through the fence. \nDoctor Strange: Jonathan Pangborn, C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.\nPangborn: Who are you?\nDoctor Strange: Paralyzed from the mid-chest down. Partial paralysis of both hands.\nPangborn: I don\u2019t know you.\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2019m Stephen Strange. I\u2019m a neurosurgeon. Was a neurosurgeon.\nPangborn: Actually, you know what, man? I think I know you. I came to your office once. You refused to see me. I never got past your assistant.\nDoctor Strange: You were untreatable.\nPangborn: No glory for you in that, right?\nDoctor Strange: You came back from a place there is no way back from! I\u2026 I\u2019m trying to find my own way back.\n\nHey, Pangborn, you in it or not?\n\nPangborn: Alright. I\u2019d given up on my body. I thought my mind was the only thing I had left. I should at least try to elevate that. So I sat with gurus, and sacred women. Strangers carried me to mountain tops to see holy men. And finally, I found my teacher. And my mind was elevated. And my spirit deepened. And somehow\u2026\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Your body healed. \n\nPangborn: Yes. And there were deeper secrets to learn then, but I did not have the strength to receive them. I chose to settle for my miracle, and I came back home. The place you\u2019re looking for is called Kamar-Taj. But the cost is high.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: How much?\n\nPangborn: I\u2019m not talking about money. Good luck.\n\nGive me the ball!\nKathmandu, Nepal\nExcuse me. Kamar-Taj?\nDo you know where Kamar-Taj is?\nSign: \"Himalayan Healing!\nFind Peace! Find Yourself!\"\nKamar-Taj?\nKamar-Taj\u2026\nOkay.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Guys, I\u2026 I don\u2019t have any money.\n\n- Your watch.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No, please. It\u2019s all I have left.\n\n- Your watch.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: All right.\n\nMordo: You\u2019re looking for Kamar-Taj?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Really? Are you sure you got the right place? That one looks a little more...Kamar-Taj-y.\n\nMordo: I once stood in your place. And I, too, was\u2026 disrespectful. So might I offer you some advice Forget everything you think you know.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Uh\u2026 alright.\n\nMordo: The sanctuary of our teacher, the Ancient One.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: The Ancient One? What\u2019s his real name? Right. Forget everything I think I know. I\u2019m sorry. Thank you for\u2026 huh! Okay, that\u2019s, uh\u2026 a thing\u2026Thank you. Hello. Uh, thank you. And thank you. Uh, thank you, Ancient One\u2026for\u2026 seeing me\u2026\n\nThe Ancient One: You\u2019re very welcome. Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir. Mr. Strange!\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Doctor, actually.\n\nThe Ancient One: Well, no. Not anymore, surely. Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re here? You\u2019ve undergone many procedures. Seven, right?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah\u2026Good tea.\n\nThe Ancient One: Yes.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man?\n\nThe Ancient One: In a way.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You helped him to walk again.\n\nThe Ancient One: Yes. \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: How do you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?\n\nThe Ancient One: Oh, I didn\u2019t correct it. He couldn\u2019t walk; I convinced him that he could.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You\u2019re not suggesting it was psychosomatic?\n\nThe Ancient One: When you reattach a severed nerve, is it you who heals it back together or the body?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: It\u2019s the cells.\n\nThe Ancient One: And the cells are only programmed to put themselves together in very specific ways.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: That\u2019s right. \n\nThe Ancient One: What if I told you that your own body could be convinced to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You\u2019re talking about cellular regeneration. That\u2019s\u2026 bleeding-edge medical tech. Is that why you\u2019re working here, without a governing medical board? I mean\u2026 just how experimental is your treatment?\n\nThe Ancient One: Quite.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: So, you figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?\n\nThe Ancient One: No, Mr. Strange. I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Spirit\u2026 to heal the body. Huh. A\u2026 Al\u2026 Al\u2026 alright. How do we do that? Where do we start?\n\nThe Ancient One: Don\u2019t like that map?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Oh, no. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s very good. It\u2019s just\u2026you know, I\u2019ve seen it before. In gift shops.\n\nThe Ancient One: And what about this one?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?\n\nThe Ancient One: What about\u2026 that one?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You\u2019re showing me an MRI scan? I can not believe this.\n\nThe Ancient One: Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part, but not the whole.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I spent my last dollar getting here on a one-way ticket, and you\u2019re talking to me about healing through belief?\n\nThe Ancient One: You\u2019re a man who\u2019s looking at the world through a keyhole, and you spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole. To see more, know more. And now, on hearing that it can be widened in ways you can\u2019t imagine, you reject the possibility?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief. There is no such thing as spirit! We are made of matter, and nothing more. We\u2019re just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe.\n\nThe Ancient One: You think too little of yourself.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Oh, you think you see through me, do you? Well, you don\u2019t. But I see through you!!! What did you just do to me?!? \n\nThe Ancient One: I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What\u2019s in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?\n\nThe Ancient One: Just tea. With a little honey.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What just happened? \n\nThe Ancient One: For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What?? \n\nThe Ancient One: A place where the soul exists apart from the body.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Why are you doing this to me?\n\nThe Ancient One: To show you just how much you don\u2019t know. Open your eye.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No! No\u2026 No! Shit! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! This isn\u2019t real it isn\u2019t real it isn\u2019t\n\nMordo: His heart rate are getting dangerously high.\n\nThe Ancient One: He looks alright to me. You think you know how the world works? You think that this material\u00a0universe is all there is? What is real? What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses? At the root of existence, mind and matter meet. Thoughts shape reality. This universe is only one of an infinite number. Worlds without end. Some benevolent and life-giving, others filled with malice and hunger. Dark places, where powers older than time lie\u2026 ravenous\u2026 and waiting. Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange? Have you seen that before in a gift shop?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Teach me!\n\nThe Ancient One: No.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No\u2026 No! No, no, no, no no no no! No! Open the door! Please!\n\nThe Ancient One: Thank you, Masters. You think I\u2019m wrong to cast him out?\n\nMordo: 5 hours later, he\u2019s still on your doorstep. There\u2019s a strength to him.\n\nThe Ancient One: Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition\u2026I\u2019ve seen it all before.\n\nMordo: He reminds you of Kaecilius?\n\nThe Ancient One: I can not lead another gifted student to power, only to lose him to the darkness.\n\nMordo: You didn\u2019t lose me. I wanted the power to defeat my enemies. You gave me the power to defeat my demons. And to live within the natural law.\n\nThe Ancient One: We never lose our demons, Mordo. We only learn to live above them.\n\nMordo: Kaecilius still has the stolen pages. If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all. There may be dark days ahead. Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Don\u2019t shut me out. I\u2019ve nowhere else to go. Thank you.\n\nMordo: Bathe, rest, meditate if you can. The Ancient One will send for you.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Uh, what\u2019s this? My mantra?\n\nMordo: The Wi-Fi password. We\u2019re not savages.\n\nTime will tell how much I love you.\n- Christine\n\nThe Ancient One: The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization. The sorcerers of antiquity called the use of this language \"spells\". But if that word offends your modern sensibilities, you can call it \"program\". The source code that shapes reality. We harness energy drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse, to cast spells, conjure shields and weapons to make magic.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: But\u2026 even if my fingers could do that, My hands would just be waving in the air. I mean, how do I get from here to there?\n\nThe Ancient One: How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and put a human spine back together bone by bone?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Study and practice. Years of it. Hey.\n\nWong: Mr. Strange.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Uh\u2026 Stephen, please. And you are?\n\nWong: Wong. \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Wong. Just Wong? Like\u2026 Adele? Or\u2026 Aristotle. Drake. Bono. Eminem.\n\nWong: The Book of the Invisible Sun, Astronomia Nova, Codex Imperium, Key of Solomon. You finished all of this?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yup.\n\nWong: Come with me.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Alright.\n\nWong: This section is for Masters only. But at my discretion, others may use it. We should start with Maxim\u2019s Primer. How is your Sanskrit?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2019m fluent in Google Translate.\n\nWong: Read it. Classical Sanskrit.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What are those?\n\nWong: The Ancient One\u2019s private collection.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: So they\u2019re forbidden?\n\nWong: No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden. Only certain practices. Those books are far too advanced for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: This one\u2019s got pages missing.\n\nWong: That\u2019s the book of Cagliostro. The study of time. One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master. A zealot called Kaecilius. Just after he strung up the former librarian, and relieved him of his head. I\u2019m now the guardian of these books. So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again, I\u2019d know it. And you\u2019d be dead before you ever left the compound.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What if it\u2019s just overdue? You know? Any\u2026 late fees I should know about? Maybe, perhaps, uhm\u2026Uh, you know, people used to think that I was funny.\n\nWong: Did they work for you?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Alright. Well, it\u2019s been lovely talking to you, thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and for the threat upon my life.\n\nKaecilius: Now we receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us. The one who betrays the world.\n\nMordo: Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts. They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse. All you need to do is focus. Visualize. See the destination in your mind. Look beyond the world in front of you. Imagine every detail. The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier, the gateway will come. And stop.\n\nThe Ancient One: I\u2019d like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.\n\nMordo: Of course.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: My hands.\n\nThe Ancient One: It\u2019s not about your hands.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: How is this not about my hands?\n\nThe Ancient One: Master Hamir. Thank you, Master Hamir. You cannot beat a river into submission. You have to surrender to its current, and use its power as your own.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2026 I control it by surrendering control? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nThe Ancient One: Not everything does. Not everything has to. Your intellect has taken you far in life. But it will take you no further. Surrender, Stephen. Silence your ego and your power will rise. Come with me.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Wait. Is this\u2026\n\nThe Ancient One: Everest. It\u2019s beautiful. \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah, you\u2019re right. Beautiful. It\u2019s freezing, but\u2026 beautiful.\n\nThe Ancient One: At this temperature, a person can last for 13 minutes before suffering permanent loss of function. \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Great.\n\nThe Ancient One: But you will likely go into shock within the first 2 minutes. \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What?\n\nThe Ancient One: Surrender, Stephen.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No, no!!! Don\u2019t!\n\nMordo: How is our new recruit?\n\nThe Ancient One: We shall see. Any second now.\n\nMordo: No, not again. Maybe I should\u2026\n\nWong: Stephen.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Wong.\n\nWong: What do you want, Strange?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Books on astral projection.\n\nWong: You\u2019re not ready for that.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Try me, Beyonce. Come on. You\u2019ve heard of her. She\u2019s a huge star, right? Do you ever laugh? Oh come on, just give me the book, huh?\n\nWong: No.\n\nThe Ancient One: Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn. Now I\u2019m told you question every lesson, preferring to teach yourself.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes. Now I\u2019m being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense.\n\nThe Ancient One: Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Wong told on me? \n\nThe Ancient One: You\u2019re advancing quickly with your sorcery skills. You need a safe space to practice your spells. You are now inside the Mirror Dimension. Ever present but undetected. The real world isn\u2019t affected by what happens here. We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil, and sometimes to contain threats. You don\u2019t want to be stuck in here without your sling ring.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats?\n\nThe Ancient One: Learning of an infinite multiverse included learning of infinite dangers. And if I told you everything else that you don\u2019t already know, you\u2019d run from here in terror.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: So, just how ancient is she?\n\nMordo: No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme. Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You follow her even though you don\u2019t know?\n\nMordo: I know that she\u2019s steadfast, but unpredictable. Merciless, yet kind. She made me what I am. Trust your teacher. And don\u2019t lose your way.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Like Kaecilius?\n\nMordo: That\u2019s right.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You knew him.\n\nMordo: When he first came to us, he\u2019d lost everyone he ever loved. He was a grieving and broken man, searching for answers in the mystic arts. A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong. Questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching. He left Kamar-Taj. His disciples followed him like sheep, seduced by false doctrine.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: He stole the forbidden ritual, right?\n\nMordo: Yeah.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What did it do?\n\nMordo: No more questions.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What\u2019s that?\n\nMordo: That\u2019s a question. This is a relic. Some magic is too powerful to sustain, so we imbue objects with it, allowing them to take the strain we can not. This is the Staff of the Living Tribunal. There are many relics: the Wand of Watoomb, the Bolting Boots of Voltor.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: They just roll of the tongue, don\u2019t they? When do I get my relic?\n\nMordo: When you\u2019re ready.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I think I\u2019m ready.\n\nMordo: You\u2019re ready when the relic decides you\u2019re ready. For now, conjure a weapon.\n\nYeah.\n\nMordo: Fight! Fight like your life depended on it! Because one day, it may.\n\nChristine\nI\u2019m emailing you one more time to\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Wong? Okay. First, open the Eye of Agamotto. All right. Oh my. Dormammu. The Dark Dimension. Eternal life?\n\n[after Strange has been caught reading the text Kaecilius stole and learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto]\n\nMordo: Stop!!!\n\nTampering with the continuum of probability is forbidden!\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2026 I wa\u2026 I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!\nAnd what did the book say about the dangers of performing that ritual?\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. I hadn\u2019t gotten to that part yet.\nTemporal manipulations can create branches in time. Unstable dimensional openings. Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!!!\nMordo: You want to get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever, or never having existed at all?\nDr. Stephen Strange: They really should put the warnings before that stuff.\nYour curiosity could have gotten you killed.\nYou weren\u2019t manipulating the space-time continuum, you were wrecking it.\nWe do not tamper with natural law. We defend it.\nHow did you learn to do that?\nWhere did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2019ve got a photographic memory. It\u2019s how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.\n\nMordo: What you just did takes more than a good memory. You were born for the mystic arts.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: And yet, my hands still shake.\n\n- For now, yes.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Not forever?\n\nMordo: We\u2019re not prophets.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: When do you start telling me what we are?\n\nWhile heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats. \nThe Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme, going back thousands of years\nto the father of the mystic arts, the mighty Agamotto.\nThe same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.\nAgamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power, where great cities now stand.\nThat door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum, that door to the New York Sanctum. That one, to the London Sanctum.\nTogether, the Sanctums generate a protective shield around our world.\nMordo: The Sanctums protect the world, and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.\nDr. Stephen Strange: From what?\nOther-dimensional beings that threaten our universe.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Like Dormammu?\nWhere did you learn that name?\nDr. Stephen Strange: I just read it in The Book of Cagliostro. Why?\nDormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension, beyond time.\nHe is the cosmic conquerer, the destroyer of worlds.\nA being of infinite power and endless hunger, on a quest to invade every universe and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.\nAnd he hungers for Earth most of all.\nThe pages that Kaecilius stole.\nA ritual to contact Dormammu and draw power from the Dark Dimension.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Uuuh\u2026 okay. Okay. I\u2026 time-out. I\u2026 I came here to heal my hands, not to fight in some mystical war.\nLondon.\nKaecilius!\nNo!!!\nDr. Stephen Strange: Wong? Mordo?\n177A Bleecker Street\nHello?\nHello?\n\nKaecilius: Daniel. I see they made you Master of the Sanctum.\n\nMaster: Do you know what that means?\n\nKaecilius: That you\u2019ll die protecting it.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Stop!\n\nKaecilius: How long have you been at Kamar-TaJ, Mister\u2026?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Doctor.\n\nKaecilius: Just Doctor?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: It\u2019s Strange.\n\nKaecilius: Maybe. Who am I to judge? You don\u2019t know how to use that, do you?\n\nWhat?\nYou\u2019ll die here.\n- Oh, stop it.\nI said, stop it!\n\nKaecilius: You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor. \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Why\u2026look, I don\u2019t even know what \"this\" is.\n\nKaecilius: It\u2019s the end and the beginning. The many becoming the few, becoming the One.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Look, if you\u2019re not going to start making sense, I\u2019m just going to have to put this thing back on.\n\nKaecilius: Tell me, Mr. Doctor.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Alright, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.\n\nKaecilius: You are a doctor?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yes. \n\nKaecilius: A scientist. You understand the laws of nature. All things age. All things die. In the end, our sun burns out, our universe grows cold and perishes. But the Dark Dimension\u2026 it\u2019s a place beyond time.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: That\u2019s it. I\u2019m putting this thing back on.\n\nKaecilius: This world doesn\u2019t have to die, Doctor. This world can take its rightful place among so many others, as part of the One. The great and beautiful One. And we can all live forever.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Really? What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?\n\nKaecilius: The same as you. The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life. People think in terms of good and evil, but really, time is the true enemy of us all. Time kills everything.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What about the people you killed?\n\nKaecilius: Tiny, momentary specks within an indifferent universe. Yes. You see, you see what we\u2019re doing? The world is not what it ought to be. Humanity longs for the eternal, for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us. Time is an insult. Death is an insult. Doctor\u2026We don\u2019t seek to rule this world. We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu, who is the intent of all evolution, the Why of all existence.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.\n\nKaecilius: What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor? Was it enlightenment? Power? You came to be healed, as did we all. Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things. We all come with the promise of being healed, but instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks. The real magic she keeps for herself. Have you ever wondered how she managed to live this long?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2026 I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro.\n\nKaecilius: So, you know. The ritual gives me the power to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down, to let the Dark Dimension in. Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely: life, everlasting. He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor, he is the savior of worlds.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No. I mean, come on. Look at your face. Dormammu made you a murderer. Just how good can his kingdom be? You think that\u2019s funny?\n\nKaecilius: No. No, Doctor. What\u2019s funny is that you\u2019ve lost your sling ring.\n\nSir, can I help you?\nDr. Stephen Strange: Dr. Palmer, where is she?\nSir, we need to\u2026\nDr. Stephen Strange: Where is she?\n- At the nurses station.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Christine!\n\nChristine: Stephen? Oh my god. What\u2026\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: We need to get me on an operation table now. Just you. Now! I don\u2019t have any time!\n\nChristine: What happened?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.\n\nChristine: What are you wearing?\n\nThe chest cavity is clear.\n- The blood\u2026 is in the pericardial sac.\nNo. No no no no no no no!\n\nChristine: Stephen! Stephen!\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Just a little higher. Please be careful with the needle.\n\nChristine: Stephen? Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: My astral body.\n\nChristine: Are you dead?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No, Christine, but I am dying.\n\nRight. Right.\nYeah. Alright.\n\nChristine: I\u2019ve\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen a wound like this before. What were you stabbed with?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to have to vanish now.\n\nChristine: No, I\u2026\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Keep me alive, will you?\n\nChristine: Okay! Okay.\n\nOh shit!\nCharging to 200 Joule\n\nChristine: Stephen, come on.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Hit me again!\n\nChristine: Stop doing that!\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Up the voltage and hit me again.\n\nChristine: No, your heart is beating!\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Just do it!\n\nOh god!\nAre you ok?\n- Hey there.\nOkay.\n\nChristine: After all this time, you just show up here, flying out of your body?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah, I know. I missed you too, by the way. I wrote 2 emails, but you never responded.\n\nChristine: Why would I?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Christine, I am so, so sorry. For all of it. And you were right, I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly and you deserved so much more.\n\nChristine: Stop. You\u2026 you\u2019re clearly in shock. I mean, what the hell is happening? Where have you been?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Well, after Western medicine failed me, I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu.\n\nChristine: Kathmandu?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah.\n\nChristine: What, like the Bob Seger song?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: 1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj and I talked to someone called the Ancient One, and\u2026\n\nChristine: Oh. So you joined a cult.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No, I didn\u2019t. Not exactly. I mean, they did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed.\n\nChristine: Yeah, that sounds like a cult.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: It\u2019s not a cult.\n\nChristine: Well, that\u2019s what a cultist would say.\n\n- Oh, no.\n\nChristine: Wait, Stephen\u2026 what do you think you\u2019re doing?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2019m late for a cult meeting.\n\nChristine: This is insane.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah.\n\nChristine: Where are you going?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Uhm\u2026\n\nChristine: Just tell me the truth?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave himself over to an ancient entity who can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me, but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village, and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway that I opened up in the mop closet.\n\nChristine: Okay. Don\u2019t tell me. Fine.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I really do have to go.\n\nMordo: Strange! You\u2019re okay.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: A relative term, but yeah, I\u2019m okay.\n\nMordo: The Cloak of Levitation. It came to you.\n\nThe Ancient One: No minor feat. It\u2019s a fickle thing.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: He\u2019s escaped.\n\n- Kaecilius?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah. He can fold space and matter at will.\n\nThe Ancient One: He folds matter outside the mirror dimension? In the real world?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah.\n\nThe Ancient One: How many more?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Two. I stranded one in the desert.\n\nAnd the other? \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: His body was in the hall. Master Drumm was in the foyer.\n\nMordo: He\u2019s been taken back to Kamar-Taj.\n\nThe London Sanctum has fallen.\nOnly New York and Hong Kong remain now to shield us from the Dark Dimension.\n\nThe Ancient One: You defended the New York Sanctum from attack. With its Master gone, it needs another, Master Strange.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No. It is Dr. Strange. Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange, Doctor Strange. When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm. And I have just killed a man! I\u2019m not doing that again. I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.\n\nThe Ancient One: You become a doctor to save one life above all others: your own.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Still seeing through me, are you?\n\nThe Ancient One: I see what I\u2019ve always seen: your over-inflated ego. You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything, even death, which no one can control. Not even the great Doctor Stephen Strange.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Not even Dormammu? He offers immortality.\n\nThe Ancient One: It\u2019s our fear of death that gives Dormammu life. He feeds off it.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Like you feed on him? You talk to me about controlling death. Well, I know how you do it. I\u2019ve seen the missing rituals from The Book of Cagliostro.\n\nThe Ancient One: Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Because you might not like them?\n\nThe Ancient One: Because you may not know of what you speak.\n\nMordo: What is he talking about?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2019m talking about her long life, the source of her immortality. She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive.\n\nMordo: That\u2019s not true.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2019ve seen the rituals and worked them out. I know how you do it.\n\nThe Ancient One: Once they regroup, the zealots will be back. You\u2019ll need reinforcements.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: She is not who you think she is.\n\nMordo: You don\u2019t have the right to say that. You have no idea of the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No, and I don\u2019t want to know.\n\nMordo: You\u2019re a coward.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Because I\u2019m not a killer?\n\nMordo: These zealots will snuff us all out, and you can muster the strength to snuff them out first?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What do you think I just did?\n\nMordo: You saved your own life! And then whined about it like a wounded dog.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: When you would have done it so easily?\n\nMordo: You have no idea the things I\u2019ve done\u2026And the answer is yes. Without hesitation.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Even if there\u2019s another way?\n\nMordo: There is no other way.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You lack imagination.\n\nMordo: No, Stephen. You lack a spine. They\u2019re back. We have to end this. Now! Strange! Get down here and fight!\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: The Mirror Dimension. You can\u2019t affect the real world in here. Who\u2019s laughing now, asshole?\n\nKaecilius: I am.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: They\u2019ve got no sling ring. I mean, they can\u2019t escape, right?\n\nRun!\n\nMordo: Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension. They can\u2019t affect the real world, but they can still kill us. This wasn\u2019t clever. This was suicide!\n\nThat is hilarious.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: This was a mistake.\n\nMordo: It\u2019s true. She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.\n\nThe Ancient One: Kaecilius.\n\nKaecilius: I came to you broken, lost, bleeding. I trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.\n\nThe Ancient One: I tried to protect you.\n\nKaecilius: From the truth? \n\nThe Ancient One: From yourself.\n\nKaecilius: I have a new teacher now.\n\nThe Ancient One: Dormammu deceives you You have no idea of what he truly is. His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.\n\nKaecilius: Liar.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Christine!!!\n\nChristine: Are you kidding me? Oh my god.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No fibrillation\u2026\n\nChristine: It\u2019s neurogenic?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yes. Nick? We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.\n\nShe still drops. \nWe\u2019re losing her!\n- You need to increase her oxygen!\nI need a crash cart!\n- Her pupils are dilated!\nNo reflexes.\nI\u2019m not reading any brain activity.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What are you doing? You\u2019re dying! You have to return to your body now. You don\u2019t have time.\n\nThe Ancient One: Time is relative. Your body hasn\u2019t even hit the floor yet. I\u2019ve spent so many years peering through time, looking at this exact moment. But I can\u2019t see past it. I\u2019ve prevented countless terrible futures. And after each one, there\u2019s always another. And they all lead here, but never further.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You think this is where you die.\n\nThe Ancient One: Do you wonder what I see in your future?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No. Yes. \n\nThe Ancient One: I never saw your future, only its possibilities. You have such a capacity for goodness. You always excelled, but not because you crave success, but because of your fear of failure.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: It\u2019s what made me a great doctor.\n\nThe Ancient One: It\u2019s precisely what kept you from greatness. Arrogance and fear still keep you from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Which is?\n\nThe Ancient One: It\u2019s not about you. When you first came to me, you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn. I didn\u2019t. He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange:He uses magic to walk.\n\nThe Ancient One: Constantly. He had a choice: to return to to his own life, or to serve something greater than himself.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: So, I could have my hands back again? My old life?\n\nThe Ancient One: You could. And the world would be all the lesser for it. I\u2019ve hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension, but as you well know, sometimes one must break the rules in order to serve the greater good.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Mordo won\u2019t see it that way.\n\nThe Ancient One: Mordo\u2019s soul is rigid and unmovable, forged by the fires of his youth. He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength. Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I\u2019m not ready.\n\nThe Ancient One: No one ever is. We don\u2019t get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered, your time is short. You\u2019d think after all this time I\u2019d be ready. But look at me: stretching one moment out into a thousand, just so I can watch the snow.\n\nChristine: Are you okay?\n\nI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening.\n- I know.\nBut I have to go right now.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: You said that losing my hands didn\u2019t have to be the end, that it could be a beginning.\n\nChristine: Yeah.\n\nBecause there are other ways to save lives.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange:A harder way.\n\nChristine: A weirder way.\n\nDr. Palmer, the ER, please.\nDr. Palmer, the ER.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I don\u2019t want to let you go.\n\nStop.\nHong Kong\n\nWong: Choose your weapon wisely. No one steps foot in this Sanctum. No one. Kaecilius.\n\nKaecilius: You\u2019re on the wrong side of history, Wong.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: She\u2019s dead.\n\nMordo: You were right. She wasn\u2019t who I thought she was.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: She was complicated.\n\nMordo: Complicated? The Dark Dimension is volatile, dangerous. What if it overtook her? She taught us it was forbidden, while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: She did what she thought was right.\n\nMordo: The bill comes due. Don\u2019t you see? Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu. Kaecilius was her fault. And here we are, in the consequence of her deception: a world on fire.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen, and New York has been attacked. Twice. You know where they\u2019re going next. Hong Kong. You told me once to fight as if my life depended on it, because one day, it might. Well, today is that day. I can not defeat them alone.\n\nMordo: The Sanctum has already fallen. The Dark Dimension. Dormammu is coming. It\u2019s too late. Nothing can stop him. \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Not necessarily.\n\nNo.\nDr. Stephen Strange: Spells working. We got a second chance.\nNo!\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Wong! I\u2019m breaking the laws of nature, I know.\n\nWong: Well, don\u2019t stop now.\n\nWhen the Sanctum is restored, they will\nattack again. We have to defend it.\nCome on!\nGet up, Strange. Get up and fight!\nWe will finish this.\n\nKaecilius: You can\u2019t fight the inevitable. Isn\u2019t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Beyond time\u2026\n\nStrange!\n\nKaecilius: He\u2019s gone. Stephen Strange has left to surrender to his power.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Dormammu! I\u2019ve come to bargain.\n\nDormammu: You\u2019ve come to die. Your world is now my world, like all worlds.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Dormammu! I\u2019ve come to bargain.\n\nDormammu: You\u2019ve come to die. Your world is now my world...What is this? Illusion? \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No, this is real.\n\nDormammu: Good.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Dormammu! I\u2019ve come to bargain.\n\nDormammu: You\u2026 what is happening?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension,\u00a0I\u2019ve brought a little power from mine. This is time: endless looped time.\n\nDormammu: You dare!\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Dormammu! I\u2019ve come to bargain.\n\nDormammu: You cannot do this forever.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Actually, I can. This is how things are now: you and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly.\n\nDormammu: Then you will spend eternity dying.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.\n\nDormammu: But you will suffer.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Pain is an old friend. Dormammu! I\u2019ve come to bargain.\n\nDormammu: End this!\n\nDr. Strange: Dormammu!\u2026 Dormammu!\u2026 Dormammu!\u2026 [time loop]\n\nDormammu: You will never win.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No\u2026But I can lose. Again, and again, and again, and again, forever. And that makes you my prisoner.\n\nDormammu: No. Stop! Make this stop!!! Set me free!\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: No. I\u2019ve come to bargain.\n\nDormammu: Oh, what do you want?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Take your zealots from the Earth, end your assault on my world, never come back: do it, and I\u2019ll break the loop.\n\nGet up, Strange.\nGet up and fight!\nWe will finish this.\n\nKaecilius: Isn\u2019t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death. What have you done?\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: I made a bargain.\n\nKaecilius: What is this? \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Well, it\u2019s, uh\u2026it\u2019s everything you ever wanted: eternal life as part of the One. You\u2019re not going to like it. I think he really should have stolen the whole book, because the warnings\u2026 the warnings come after the spells.\n\nWong: Oh, that\u2019s funny.\n\nWe did it.\nYes.\nYes, we did it.\nBy also violating the natural laws.\nLook around you. It\u2019s over.\n\nMordo: You still think there will be no consequences, Strange? No price to pay? We broke our rules, just like her. The bill comes due. Always. A reckoning. I will follow this path no longer.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s okay.\n\nWong: Wise choice. You\u2019ll wear the Eye of Agamotto once you\u2019ve mastered its powers. Until then, best not to walk the streets wearing an Infinity Stone.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: A what?\n\nWong: You might have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn. Word of the Ancient One\u2019s death will spread through the Multiverse. Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it. We must be ready.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: We\u2019ll be ready.\n\n[Mid-Credits scene: Thor is meeting with Strange\n\nThor: So, Earth has wizards now, huh? \n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Tea?\n\nThor: I don\u2019t drink tea.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: What do you drink?\n\nThor: Not tea.\n\n[Strange uses his powers to transform the teacup Thor is holding into a stein of beer]\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.\n\nThor: A worthy inclusion.\n\nDr. Stephen Strange: Yeah. So, why bring him here to New York?\n\nThor: That's a long story. A family drama, that kind of thing, but\u2026 we\u2019re looking for my father.\n\nDoctor Strange: Oh, okay. So, if you\u2019ve found Odin, you all will return to Asgard, probably?\n\nThor: Oh, yes. Probably.\n\nDoctor Strange: Alright.\u00a0Let me help you.\n\n[Post-Credits scene: Jonathan Pangborn senses someone in his workshop]\n\nJonathan: Can I help you?\n\nKarl Mordo: They carried you into Kamar-Taj on a strecher. Look at you now. Pangborn.\n\nJonathan: Mordo. So, what can I do for you? Man!\n\nKarl Mordo: You been away many months now and I heard a revelation. The true purpose of a sorcerer is to twist things out of there proper shape. Stealing power, providing nature\u2026 like you.\n\nJonathan: I stolen nothing. This is my power. Mine.\n\nKarl Mordo: Power\u2026 has a purpose.\n\n[Pangborn picks up a crowbar and tries to attack Mordo, but Mordo takes his powers and makes Pangborn paralysed again]\n\nJonathan: Why you doing this?\n\nKarl Mordo: Because I see it long last was wrong with the world. Too many sorcerers.\n\n[the final screen text shows\" Doctor Strange will return\"]\n\n\n\n\n"

This is definitely not the\nfirst time they\u2019ve done this.\nQUILL (CONT\u2019D)\nDrax thinks you\u2019re not a dancer.\nGAMORA\nIf you ever tell anyone about this,\nI\u2019ll kill you.\nThey look at each other.\nQUILL\nWhen are we going to do something\nabout this... unspoken thing\nbetween us?\nGAMORA\nWhat unspoken thing?\nQUILL\nThis Cheers-Sam-and-Diane-guy-andgirl-on-a-TV-show-who-dig-eachother-but-never-say-it-\u2019cause-whenthey-do-the-ratings-would-go-down\nsort of thing?\n\n\u00a9 Marvel\n\n\f79\nGAMORA\nThere is no unspoken thing between\nus.\nQUILL\nWell, that\u2019s a Catch-22.

You like me\nbeing the weak one!\nGamora adds some pieces to her transmitter.\nGAMORA\nUh. You were insufferable to begin\nwith. I haven\u2019t been able to reach\nRocket. I\u2019m going to see if I can\nget a signal outside.\nQUILL\nYou know, this isn\u2019t Cheers after\nall. It\u2019s whatever the show is\nwhere one person is willing to, you\nknow, open themselves up to new\npossibilities, and the other person\nis just kind of a jerk who doesn\u2019t\ntrust anyone! It\u2019s a show that\ndoesn\u2019t exist - it would never be\nmade, it would be so horrible! It\nwould get zero ratings!\nGAMORA\nYou\u2019re having a conversation with\nyourself!

        "text": "[The screen first panels up to an arrow being nocked into a bow. The archer behind firmly grips it tight as it was aiming towards the target. The camera reveals Clint Barton holding up a few arrows while mentoring his daughter, Lila Barton, on shooting one.]\nCLINT BARTON: Okay, hold on. Don't shoot. You see where you're going?\nLILA BARTON: Mhm.\nCLINT BARTON: Okay, now let's worry about how you get there. [Clint corrects his daughter's foot to the proper position, and adjusts her shooting stance.]\nCLINT BARTON: Here. Can you see?\nLILA BARTON: Yeah.\nCLINT BARTON: You sure?\nLILA BARTON: Mhm. [Clint pushes Lila's hair in front of her face while covering her left eye.]\nCLINT BARTON: How about now?\n[Both Lila and Clint giggle, as the camera panels into a long shot showing a target nailed on a tree, and the rest of Barton family having a picnic in the field.]\nCLINT BARTON: Alright. Ready your fingers.\nCOOPER BARTON: Nice.\nLAURA BARTON: Nice throw, kiddo.\nCOOPER BARTON: You go.\nLAURA BARTON: Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.]\nLILA BARTON: Who wants mayo on a hotdog?\nCLINT BARTON: Probably your brothers.\n[Clint looks at his wife, Laura]\nCLINT BARTON: Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel]\nLAURA BARTON: Mayo or mustard?\nNATHANIEL BARTON: How about ketchup?\nLAURA BARTON: Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter]\nCLINT BARTON: Mind your elbow. [Lila releases the arrow and it hits the target directly in the bullseye.] Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.\nLAURA BARTON: Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!\nCLINT BARTON: Alright, we're coming; we're hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there's no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.] Lila, let's go. [Clint starts to look around] Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.] Honey? [Clint looks around to see Laura and the boys, only they are gone now. He looks seriously panicked and confused as he hurriedly drops the arrows and jogs over to where they were.] Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?\n[Lightning crackles]\n[SOMEWHERE IN\u00a0SPACE]\n[Opening sequence begins with Dear Mr. Fantasy playing]\n[Scene switches to Nebula and Tony on the ship playing paper football]\nNEBULA: Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony.]\nTONY STARK: You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony] Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony] That's a goal. We're now one apiece.\nNEBULA: I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony]\nTONY STARK: We tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.\n[Tony poorly flicks a paper football towards Nebula]\nTONY STARK: That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony]\nTONY STARK: And... you've won. Congratulations. [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula's hand]\nTONY STARK: Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony's hand] Have fun?\nNEBULA: It was fun.\n[Camera switches to see Iron Man's busted helmet. Tony Stark's hand reaches forward to turn on the helmet. We pan out to see that he's sitting on the floor of a gloomy Benatar. The weight of the recent events of INFINITY WAR evident in Tony's posture. He taps the helmet with a sigh.]\nTONY STARK: This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks skinnier and weak with malnutrition.] Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.] You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.] You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebula working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.] But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you.\n[With that, Tony turns the helmet off. He rubs his thumb over the left eye, and then leans down, to what would be his last sleep. Nebula walks over to him, and carries him to Drax's seat, and lies him there. She walks away dejected.]\n[A vast bluish nebula illuminates the space surrounding them. Cut to a shot of Tony's face, which for the first time shows age and weakness. There is a light on his face, which grows brighter and brighter until he's forced to open his eyes. The camera pans around to the light source, which is slowly revealed to be CAROL DANVERS.]\n[A bathroom in the Avengers compound. We see Steve Rogers holding a blade, having just shaved off his beard. He sighs and looks into a side mirror. The mirror suddenly starts shaking, slowly at first, and then severely. Cut to the yard in the Avengers Compound, we see Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and James Rhodes walking out looking at something, the Benatar carried by Carol Danvers as she lands the spacecraft. The landing gears deploy as they touch down. The entry hatch opens, and Tony and Nebula walk out, Tony being supported by Nebula. Steve runs to Tony to help him stand up. Tony grips Steve's arm as he joins him.]\nTONY STARK: Couldn't stop him.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Neither could I.\nTONY STARK: I lost the kid.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Tony, we lost.\nTONY STARK: Is, uh...? [Tony struggles to ask about Pepper.]\nPEPPER POTTS: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [She and Tony embrace.]\nTONY STARK: It's okay.\n[Rocket Raccoon sits down with Nebula and takes her hand, both silently mourning their losses. In the Avengers Compound. The heroes are sitting in a living room area. Tony is sitting at a table, getting blood for healing. A holographic casualty report lists the names and faces of those lost to the Decimation.]\nJAMES RHODES: It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures.\nTONY STARK: Where is he now? Where?\nSTEVE ROGERS: We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through.\n[Cut to a shot of a sullen-looking Thor, sitting on a bench, seemingly deep in thought.]\nTONY STARK: What's wrong with him?\nROCKET: Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?\nTONY STARK: Honestly, until this exact second, I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.\nROCKET: Maybe I am.\nSTEVE ROGERS: We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him.\nTONY STARK: Who told you that? [Surprised] I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Okay.\nTONY STARK: He's unbeatable.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?\nTONY STARK: Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.\nTONY STARK: [starting to seethe] And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need? [Tony stands, pushing things off the table with a clatter. Everyone winces at the noise.] I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -\n[Tony goes for Steve. Rhodey quickly comes in front of him, trying to stop him.]\nRHODEY: Tony, Tony, Tony!\nTONY STARK: Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!\nSTEVE ROGERS: Well, that didn't work out, did it?\nTONY STARK: I said, \"we'd lose\". You said, \"We'll do that together too.\" And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers.\nRHODEY: Okay.\nTONY STARK: Right?\nRHODEY: You made your point. Just sit down.\nTONY STARK: Okay...\nRHODEY: Okay?\nTONY STARK: Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?\nRHODEY: Tony, you're sick.\nTONY STARK: [Referring to Carol] She's great, by the way.\nRHODEY: Sit down. Sit.\nTONY STARK: We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules! [Tony walks right up to Steve's face, his voice hushing down to a venomous whisper] I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.\n[Steve looks affected by Tony's words. The old friends just gaze at each other. After a moment, Tony rips his Arc Reactor from his chest and shoves it into Steve's hand.]\nTONY STARK: Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.\n[Tony falls to the ground. Steve is by his side and everyone is starting to gather.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Tony!\nTONY STARK: I'm fine. I...\n[Tony falls into a heap, unconscious.]\n[Cut to a shot of Tony on a bed, with Pepper at his side.]\nRHODEY: Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.\nCAROL DANVERS: You guys take care of him. And I'll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.\n[Carol walks away.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you going?\nCAROL DANVERS: To kill Thanos.\n[Steve and Natasha share a look before walking after her.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale's a little fragile.\nSTEVE ROGERS: We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too.\nRHODEY: You even know where he is?\nCAROL DANVERS: I know people who might.\nNEBULA: [Standing behind Carol] Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask \"where would we go once his plan was complete?\". His answer was always the same: \"To the Garden.\"\nRHODEY: That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan.\nSTEVE ROGERS: So where is he?\nROCKET: When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.] On this planet.\nNEBULA: Thanos is there.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: He used the stones again.\nBRUCE BANNER: Hey, hey, hey. We'd be going in short-handed, you know.\nRHODEY: Look, he's still got the stones, so...\nCAROL DANVERS: So let's get him... Use them to bring everyone back.\nRHODEY: Just like that?\nSTEVE ROGERS: Yeah, just like that.\n[Steve and Carol share a knowing look.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.\nBRUCE BANNER: If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?\nCAROL DANVERS: Because before, you didn't have me.\nRHODEY: Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?\nCAROL DANVERS: There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.\n[Thor, who has been eating a snack behind all this time, stands up and walks over to Carol. She looks behind at him. He holds his hand up, and catches Stormbreaker as it flies over to him, missing Carol by inches. But Carol doesn't even flinch, instead smiling at the God of Thunder.]\nTHOR: I like this one. [smiles]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Let's go get this son of a bitch.\n[Title Screen: Avengers: Endgame]\n[Cut to a shot of everyone except for Tony aboard the Benatar.]\nROCKET: Okay, who here hasn't been to space?\n[Nat, Cap, and Rhodey raise their hands.]\nRHODEY: Why?\nROCKET: You better not throw up on my ship.\nNEBULA: Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!\n[The ship jumps forward into a wormhole, and we see Steve holding onto his seat for dear life. A close up of his eyes show them widening slightly at the exhilaration of this new experience. The ship slows down, and the ship hovers in orbit of the planet seen in the hologram previously. Carol Danvers hovers in front of the Benatar.]\nCAROL DANVERS: I'll head down for recon.\n[A shot of the passengers inside the Benatar preparing for the impending confrontation.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: This is gonna work, Steve.\nSTEVE ROGERS: I know it will.\n[We see Steve holding a compass with an image of Peggy Carter.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.\n[Carol Danvers approaches the Benatar.]\nCAROL DANVERS: No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him.\nNEBULA: And that's enough.\n[Cut to a shot of a scenic lush tropical fauna. It surrounds a shed on a farm. A scarecrow made of Thanos' armour is seen before we cut to a shot focusing on the burnt Infinity Gauntlet on Thanos' arm. He's walking among his crops, harvesting fruit, and putting them in a sack. He walks over to the shed, with a dragging quality to his legs, like it pains him to walk, presumably his living quarters, and tries to sit down, and we see his full face. His whole left side is burnt black with blisters; He looks ridiculously pathetic compared to when we saw him last.]\n[Suddenly, Carol Danvers flies through the roof, knocking Thanos down, and grabbing his neck. Bruce in the Hulkbuster armor bursts from the ground, and grabs Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet arm. Thor flies in and slices off the Infinity Gauntlet. Rhodey flies down with Rocket and aims guns on Thanos' head.]\n[Captain America walks in his Winter Soldier Outfit, with Natasha right behind him, staring murderously at Thanos. Rocket goes over to the sliced off Infinity Gauntlet, and kicks it over, as everyone realizes that there are no stones in it.]\nROCKET: Oh no.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Where are they?\nCAROL DANVERS: Answer the question!\nTHANOS: The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.\nBRUCE BANNER: You murdered trillions! [Bruce pushes him to the ground wearing Hulk Buster armor]\nTHANOS: You should be grateful. [Punched by Hulk Buster]\nNATASHA ROMANONFF: Where are the Stones?\nTHANOS: Gone. Reduced to atoms.\nBRUCE BANNER: You used them two days ago!\nTHANOS: I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. [sits himself a little straighter.] I am... inevitable.\nRHODEY: We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying.\nNEBULA: My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.\nTHANOS: Ah, thank you, daughter. [Nebula looks down, a little uncomfortable.] Perhaps I treated you too harshly.\n[We see Thor's face filled with rage as he raises to summon Stormbreaker, and before anyone can stop him, SLICES Thanos' head off. Thanos' limp body falls to the floor. Nebula wipes off some of the blood spatter.]\nROCKET: What... What did you do?\n[Thor looks broken, realizing what he has done.]\nTHOR: I went for the head.\n[Thor slowly walks out of the shed, no real purpose in his steps as the screen blurs to nothingness.]\nFIVE\n[A pause]\nYEARS\n[pause]\nLATER\n[We see shots of New York City, seemingly abandoned. There are a lot of boats gathered around a dock, all abandoned. A baseball stadium comes into view, with no life present at all. The aftermath of the Decimation is evident, and Earth has not coped well.]\n[Cut to an abandoned cafe, with a poster on the wall labeled \"WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY'RE GONE?\". A therapy session is taking place with Steve Rogers and seven other people.]\nJOE RUSSO: So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It's the first time in five years, you know? I'm sitting there at dinner... I didn't even know what to talk about.\nSTEVE ROGERS: What did you talk about?\nJOE RUSSO: Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads.\nJIM STARLIN: What about you?\nJOE RUSSO: I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...\nSTEVE ROGERS: That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us.\n[Screen Title: SAN FRANCISCO]\n[The camera pans to San Francisco Bridge, all the way to a self-storage facility with a sign saying \"U-STORE It, SELF STORAGE\", with its interior filled with stored stuff and junk until it spots Luis' van from \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\", behind a metallic fence with a label named \"LANG\". A rat crawls over the van's rear windshield and accidentally activates the controls for opening the Quantum Realm, haphazardly activating the Quantum Tunnel. The rear door busts open, flinging Lang outside the van.]\nSCOTT LANG: [grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.] What the hell?\n[He manages to stand up, as another electrical failure sparks out of his gauntlets, and now looks around in a confused look.] \nSCOTT LANG: Hope?\n[Inside a security office, a security guard (Ken Jeong) reading a book as he looks upon his security screen, seeing something going on in one of the storage facilities. In the cameras, it shows Lang in his casual clothing, shouting, waving a sign with the word \"HELP\" written on it.]\n[Outside the facility, he pulls out a pushcart and looks back seeing the guard giving a stern look from far. He walks around until reaching his hometown, finding a post filled with MISSING posters, abandoned houses, a wrecked car, nothing but desolation. He then sees a kid in a bike pass by.]\nSCOTT LANG: [yells] Kid! Hey kid!\n[The kid stops his bike as he stares back in a serious look.]\nSCOTT LANG: What the hell happened here?\n[The kid still stares at him and is almost about to tear up, but immediately turns away from him and move on. Lang still gives the same confused look, as he arrives in somewhat a memorial called \"THE VANISHED\", with all the names of the people who became victims of the Decimation. As Lang arrives on one of the engraved stones, he immediately drops the handle in shock.]\nSCOTT LANG: No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if his daughter's name is on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no.\n[The camera keeps panning and switching as Lang checks the rest of engraved stones if her daughter's name was in one.]\nSCOTT LANG: [in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.]\nSCOTT LANG: What?\n[Scott is now seen running across the memorial, then to his hometown, only to ring a doorbell at his house, bang on the door, and try opening the door, but is found locked. Then, he sees a feminine figure appear out of a hallway inside. The figure gets closer, revealing a woman in a purple sweater, with her hand pushing towards the glass door's window, and her face filled with amazement, as she unlocked the door. It was Lang's daughter, Cassie, now a grown-up teen since the last five years.]\n[Cassie, who hasn't seen him for five years, holds up his face in an emotional sight and starts to smile tearfully. Lang does the same.]\nSCOTT LANG: Cassie?\nCASSIE LANG: Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.]\nSCOTT LANG: You're so big!\n[Both dad and daughter share a hug once more.]\n[The camera cuts to a sunset in San Francisco, showing a metal face with a sign saying in its headings, \"RESTRICTED AREA, DO NOT ENTER\" with the subtext, \"AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY BEYOND THIS POINT, SECURITY ID OR ESCORT REQUIRED\", then cuts to a scene inside the New Avengers facility, someone cutting the two bread with peanut butter filling into a couple of triangles, as someone else was speaking. The camera pans up to Romanoff, now having red, long hair, over-colouring her blonde streaks, hearing Rocket Raccoon out about his status so far.]\nROCKET: Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged.\n[The camera cuts showing a few of the Avengers in holographic calls from the left to right, respectively: Nebula and Rocket Raccoon, Okoye, Danvers with a tomboyish haircut, and Rhodes.]\nNEBULA: It was an infectious garbage scowl.\nROCKET: So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk]\nCAROL DANVERS: Well, you were closer.\nROCKET: Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: [turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors?\nOKOYE: It was a mild subduction under the African plate.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?\nOKOYE: Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: [turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month?\nCAROL DANVERS: Not likely.\nROCKET: What, you gonna get another haircut?\nCAROL DANVERS: [irritated] Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.\nROCKET: [murmurs to himself] All right, all right, that's a good point. That's a good point.\nCAROL DANVERS: So you might not see me for a long time.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me.\n[Okoye agrees in her language.]\nROCKET: Okay.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright.\n[The Avengers cut off their calls one by one...]\nCAROL DANVERS: [To Rhodey] Good luck. [cuts off call]\n[Except for Rhodes. Nat sighs exhausted, and sits down, as she notices Rhodes still online in the call.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you?\nRHODEY: Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: It's probably a rival gang.\nRHODEY: Except it isn't. [Nat realizes something.] It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left... [Nat starts to show signs of sadness as she gradually tears up.] I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him.\n[In an abrupt moment of silence, she tries to chew her tears and emotional feelings as she eats a sandwich.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Will you find out where he's going next?\nRHODEY: Nat...\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Please.\nRHODEY: [reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his]\n[Nat starts to cry as she tries to hold back her tears miserably.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. [Out of nowhere, Roger slumps over a bookshelf, in the same mood as he is in the therapy session, as Nat wipes off the tears off her face.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: You here to do your laundry?\nSTEVE ROGERS: And to see a friend.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Clearly, your friend is fine.\nSTEVE ROGERS: You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: In the Hudson?\nSTEVE ROGERS: There's fewer ships, cleaner water.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Sorry. Force of habit. [Throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair, opposite Natasha.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: If I move on, who does this?\nSTEVE ROGERS: Maybe it doesn't need to be done.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: [Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.\nSTEVE ROGERS: I think we both need to get a life.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: [Smiling] You first.\n[A camera footage pops up in front of them, showing Scott Lang with his Quantum Realm Van behind him.]\nSCOTT LANG: Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me.\nSTEVE ROGERS: [Standing up] Is this an old message?\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: [Also standing up] It's the front gate.\nSCOTT LANG: Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys.\n[Cut to Scott inside the Avengers Compound, pacing worriedly in front of Steve and Natasha.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Scott. Are you okay?\nSCOTT LANG: Yeah. I'm fine.\n[He struggles to ask about something. He finally blurts it out.]\nSCOTT LANG: Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Only to make conversation.\nSCOTT LANG: Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.\nSCOTT LANG: Yeah, but that's just it. It wasn't. For me, it was five hours.\n[Steve and Nat share a quick bewildered glance.]\nSCOTT LANG: See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.\n[He strides over to pick up Nat's sandwich, and bites into it.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Scott, what are you talking about?\nSCOTT LANG: What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Wait, are you talking about a time machine?\nSCOTT LANG: No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... There's gotta be...some w... it's crazy.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore.\nSCOTT LANG: So who do we talk to about this?\n[We cut to a cabin in the woods, at the bank of a lake. We see Tony Stark sitting outside what looks like a tiny shed.]\nTONY STARK: [Clapping his hand in a famous beat] Chow time! [He seems to be speaking to someone unknown by the audience.] Morgoona? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?\nMORGAN STARK: Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a silver and blue helmet similar to Iron Man's]\n[A girl with long dark hair walks out in front of Tony. This is Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter. She looks to be about 3-4 years of age.]\nTONY STARK: Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. [Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.]\nMORGAN STARK: Okay.\nTONY STARK: There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.\nMORGAN STARK: No.\nTONY STARK: That's what you want. How did you find this?\nMORGAN STARK: Garage.\nTONY STARK: Really? Were you looking for it?\nMORGAN STARK: No. I found it, though.\nTONY STARK: You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.\n[They start walking towards the house, but Tony notices a black Audi pulling coming to a stop a few meters away. Steve, Nat, and Scott get out of the car. Tony sighs. He is not looking forward to the discussion about to take place.]\nSCOTT LANG: [Cut to after Scott's plan has been explained to Tony] Now, we know what it sounds like...\nSTEVE ROGERS: Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?\nTONY STARK: Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?\n[Scott, Steve and Nat all look puzzled. Science is barely any of their fields.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: [Tony giving a drink to him] Thank you.\nTONY STARK: In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.\nSCOTT LANG: I did.\nTONY STARK: No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?\nSCOTT LANG: [Trying to hide his pride] A time heist?\nTONY STARK: Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?\nSCOTT LANG: The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.\nTONY STARK: Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?\nSTEVE ROGERS: I don't believe we would.\nTONY STARK: Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.\nSCOTT LANG: Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -\nTONY STARK: I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?\nSCOTT LANG: [embarrassed] No.\nTONY STARK: Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Tony... We have to take a stand.\nTONY STARK: We did stand. And yet, here we are.\nSCOTT LANG: I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. [His voice gets louder as he tries to sell his desperation to Tony.] And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. Bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even...\nTONY STARK: That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid.\n[Morgan runs to her dad, who picks her up.]\nMORGAN STARK: Mommy told me to come and save you.\nTONY STARK: Good job. I'm saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance.\nTONY STARK: I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.\n[We see Cap, Nat and Scott walking back to their car outside Tony's house.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: He's scared.\nSTEVE ROGERS: He's not wrong.\nSCOTT LANG: Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?\nSTEVE ROGERS: No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain.\nSCOTT LANG: [Incredulous, pointing to Tony's house] Bigger than his?\n[Cut to a cafe somewhere, we see Bruce Banner, but not the same one that we remember. He looks more... Professor Hulk.]\nBRUCE BANNER: Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs.\nSCOTT LANG: I'm so confused.\nBRUCE BANNER: [seriously] These are confusing times.\nSCOTT LANG: Right. No, no, that's not what I meant.\nBRUCE BANNER: [dropping the act] No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now.\nSCOTT LANG: Yeah! Wh...How? Why?\nBRUCE BANNER: Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: No one blamed you, Bruce.\nBRUCE BANNER: I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds...\n[Three children behind Bruce walk up to him tentatively]\nGIRL: Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?\nBRUCE BANNER: Yes?\nGIRL: Can we get a photo?\nBRUCE BANNER: 100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind?\nSCOTT LANG: Oh, yeah.\nBRUCE BANNER: Thanks, [To the Children] Say \"green\"! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.]\nBRUCE BANNER: Did you get that?\nSCOTT LANG: [leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.\nSCOTT LANG: They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does.\nBRUCE BANNER: Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to...[to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.]\nSCOTT LANG: He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either.\nBRUCE BANNER: But, come on, the kid! But he...but you...\nSCOTT LANG: I don't want a picture with them.\nBRUCE BANNER: [To the children] He's gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they'd do it.\nSCOTT LANG: I don't want it anymore.\nBRUCE BANNER: No, no...you feel bad.\nSCOTT LANG: Just take the goddamn phone.\n[Maybe next time, Scott.]\nGIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.\nBRUCE BANNER: No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. Hulk out!\nSTEVE ROGERS: Bruce.\nBRUCE BANNER: [Awkwardly] Dab!\nSTEVE ROGERS: Bruce.\nBRUCE BANNER: Listen to your Mom. She knows better.\nSTEVE ROGERS: About we were saying...\nBRUCE BANNER: Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.\n[The scene cuts to Tony Stark in the kitchen washing dishes after dinner. As he finishes the last of them, stumbles upon a photo of both Stark and Parker, with Parker holding his Stark Internship certificate. Tony finally knows what he's fighting for.]\n[Cut to Tony talking to his computer, generating a holographic model of something he's working on.]\nTONY STARK: Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y: Processing...\nTONY STARK: Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y: Just a moment.\nTONY STARK: And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -\nF.R.I.D.A.Y: Model rendered.\n[In a complete shock of amazement, the render comes back as 99.987% successful. Tony falls back, bewildered by this discovery.]\nTONY STARK: Shit!\nMORGAN STARK: Shit.\n[Morgan, who has been hiding behind him all this time, giggles as she repeats the word Tony just uttered.]\nTONY STARK: [Whispering] What are you doing up, little mess?\nMORGAN STARK: Shit.\nTONY STARK: No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.\nMORGAN STARK: Why you up?\nTONY STARK: 'Cause I got some important shit going on here. [Morgan gives Tony a taste of the incredulous] What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.\nMORGAN STARK: Was it Juice Pops?\nTONY STARK: Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on...[Looks back to the model, Then turns back] my mind.\n[In Morgan's room]\nTONY STARK: You done? Yeah, now you are. [Tony wiped her lips and pushing Morgan's head onto her pillow] That face goes there.\nMORGAN STARK: Tell me a story.\nTONY STARK: A story... Once upon a time, Morgoona went to bed. The end.\nMORGAN STARK: [Giggling] That's a horrible story.\nTONY STARK: Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons. [Kisses Morgan on the forehead.]\nMORGAN STARK: I love you 3000.\nTONY STARK: [Silently] Wow. [Turns off the lamp] 3000. That's crazy. [Closed the door] Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night.\n[Cut to the living room where Pepper is reading a book sitting on the couch. Tony paces in front of the fireplace.]\nTONY STARK: Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. [Pepper scoffs]\nTONY STARK: [Absentmindedly] What are you reading?\nPEPPER POTTS: Oh, it's just a book on composting.\nTONY STARK: [Still absentmindedly] What's new with composting?\nPEPPER POTTS: Just -\nTONY STARK: I figured it out, by the way.\nPEPPER POTTS: You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -\nTONY STARK: Time travel.\nPEPPER POTTS: [Amazed] What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying.\nTONY STARK: That's right.\nPEPPER POTTS: We got really lucky.\nTONY STARK: Yeah, I know.\nPEPPER POTTS: A lot of people didn't.\nTONY STARK: No, I can't help everybody.\nPEPPER POTTS: It sort a seems like you can.\nTONY STARK: Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.\nPEPPER POTTS: Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life.\n[Tony smiles]\nTONY STARK: I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.\nPEPPER POTTS: But would you be able to rest?\n[Cut to a lab in the Avengers Compound, we see Bruce fiddling with buttons on a panel. Scott is in his Ant-Man costume in front of his van, with the back open to show the Quantum Tunnel. Nat and Steve are beside Bruce]\nBRUCE BANNER: Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing.\n[Scott opens the portal]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.\nBRUCE BANNER: Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look]\nSCOTT LANG: Excuse me?\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: He's kidding. [In a hushed tone to Bruce] You can't say things like that!\nBRUCE BANNER: Just... It was a bad joke.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: You were kidding, right?\nBRUCE BANNER: [Whispering to Nat] I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [Loudly and gives Scott a thumbs up] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?\nSCOTT LANG: Perfectly not confusing\nSTEVE ROGERS: Good luck, Scott. You got this.\nSCOTT LANG: You're right. I do, Captain America.\n[Bruce presses a button, and Scott disappears into the Quantum Tunnel.]\nBRUCE BANNER: On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!\n[Bruce presses a button, and someone in the Ant-Man suit comes back. A teenager in appears out of it.]\nTEEN SCOTT LANG: Uh, guys? This...this doesn't feel right.\nSTEVE ROGERS: What is this?\nBRUCE BANNER: What's going on?\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: That...who is that?\n[He pushes another couple of buttons, trying to fix the problem.] \nBRUCE BANNER: Hold on. [Panicking]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that Scott?\nTEEN SCOTT LANG: Yes, it's Scott!\n[Teen Scott gets sucked in back into the quantum tunnel, and it appears to be an old man in the Ant-Man suit.]\nOLD SCOTT LANG: Ow! My back!\nSTEVE ROGERS: What is this?\nBRUCE BANNER: Can I get a little space here.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?\nBRUCE BANNER: I'm working on it! [Tapping the side of the button pad, trying to pull back Scott]\n[After a moment, another person appears in front of them. This time, it's a baby in the Ant-Man suit.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: It's a baby. [seriously]\nBRUCE BANNER: It's Scott.\nSTEVE ROGERS: As a baby!\nBRUCE BANNER: He'll grow.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Bring Scott back!\nBRUCE BANNER: [motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh my god. [rapidly walk near to the generator]\nBRUCE BANNER: And... Kill it!\n[Nat pulls down a lever, and everything shuts down. Scott, the normal Scott, gets spewed back out again.]\nSCOTT LANG: Somebody peed my pants.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh thank god.\nSCOTT LANG: But I don't know if it was \"baby\" me or \"old\" me...Or just \"me\" me.\nBRUCE BANNER: [holds up his his hands in a dramatic way] Time travel!\n[Steve says nothing. He simply shakes his head and walks away]\nBRUCE BANNER: What? I..I see this as an absolute win!\n[We cut to see Steve sitting outside the Avengers Compound, staring at the floor, deep in thought. He looks beat, the only possibility of victory now not an opportunity. He looks up as a deafening noise breaks the silence in the distance. As he looks, we see an Audi R8 speeding towards the entrance. The car pulls over to Cap, but goes a bit too far, then reverses to Cap. We see Tony Stark roll down the window and look at Cap.]\nTONY STARK: Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?\n[He gets out of the car, and walks around to the back.]\nTONY STARK: [Ignoring Steve's question] That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody shoulda cautioned you against it.\nSTEVE ROGERS: You did.\nTONY STARK: Oh, did I? [acting like he did not; there's the Tony we know] Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. [Makes peace sign with his fingers] Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Me too.\nTONY STARK: We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.] \n[Tony reaches back into his trunk to pull something else out, Captain America's Shield. He makes to give it to Steve, who hesitates.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Tony...\nTONY STARK: Why? He made it for you. [referring to Howard Stark] Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.\n[Steve fits his arm into the shield.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Thank you, Tony.\nTONY STARK: Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. [Hesitates] ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?\nSTEVE ROGERS: We're working on that right now.\n[Cut to the Benatar landing in the yard of the Avenger's Compound. Scott is sitting having a Taco and some Nachos at a bench, and everything falls out of the taco as the Benatar lands. Nebula and Rocket walk out of the ship, and past Scott.]\nROCKET: Hey, homie! Where's Big Green?\nSCOTT LANG: Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Nebula] That's awesome.\nNEBULA: [into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone.\n[She walks away. Moments later, just as Scott is getting back to his senses, Rhodey lands right in front of him without warning. This time Scott is so surprised, he drops the whole taco.]\nSCOTT LANG: Oh, God!\nRHODEY: What's up, regular sized man?\n[As Rhodey walks away, Bruce walks out of the Compound. Seeing that Scott dropped his lunch, he hands two tacos from his own lunch to Scott. Scott takes it while giving Bruce a puzzling look at this act of kindness.]\n[Cut to Bruce sitting at the back of a Utility car as they traverse the green countryside of Norway. They pass a sign labelled \"WELCOME TO NEW ASGARD, PLEASE DRIVE SLOWLY.\". They stop at a small town on a port. Bruce and Rocket get out of the car, and look around at the remaining Asgardians, living like normal humans at a port.]\nROCKET: Kind of a step down from a from a golden palace for an Avenger highness and whatnot.\nBRUCE BANNER: Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.]\nVALKYRIE: You shouldn't have come!\nBRUCE BANNER: Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl.\nVALKYRIE: [Noticing Bruce's change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways.\nBRUCE BANNER: [motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket.\nROCKET: How you doin'?\nVALKYRIE: [Eyeing Rocket] He won't see you.\nBRUCE BANNER: That bad, huh?\nVALKYRIE: We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs of stout and other beer on the side] ... supplies.\nBRUCE BANNER: It's that bad.\nVALKYRIE: Yeah.\n[Cut to Rocket opening a door, and him and Bruce walking through it.]\nROCKET: [Grimacing at the smell] What the...  Woo! Something died in here.\nBRUCE BANNER: Hello? Thor?\nTHOR: [From another room.] Are you here about the cable?\n[He walks into view, and the audience's jaw drops. Thor, who is shirtless, has definitely put on more than a couple of pounds since we saw him last.]\nTHOR: The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He grabs a beer]\nBRUCE BANNER: Thor?\n[He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there. He cracks into joy.] BOYS! Oh my God! Its so to see you! [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal!\nROCKET: No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary.\nTHOR: Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?\n[We see Miek and Korg sitting on a couch, PlayStation controller in hand, playing Fortnite and eating chips.]\nKORG:\u00a0Hey boys!\nBRUCE BANNER: Hey guys, long time no see.\nKORG: Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. [He goes back to his game.] Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again.\nTHOR: Noobmaster?\nKORG: Yeah, Noobmaster69 called me a dickhead.\n[Thor walks over to Korg, takes his headphones, and speaks into the mic.]\nTHOR: Noobmaster? Yeah, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms then shove them up your butt! Oh, that's right. Yes, now go cry to your father, you little weasel!\nKORG: [Thor brings his headphones back] Thank you, Thor.\nTHOR: Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?\nKORG: Thank you very much. I will.\nTHOR: So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things.\n[Thor uses Stormbreaker to open a bottle of beer and starts drinking. Bruce walks to him and places a hand on his shoulder]\nBRUCE BANNER: Buddy, you all right?\nTHOR: \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bYes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right?\nROCKET: [Concerned] You look like melted ice cream.\nTHOR: [Laughs] So, what's up?\nBRUCE BANNER: We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.\nTHOR: What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.\nBRUCE BANNER: Like Thanos.\n[Thor's smile slowly disappears. He puts a shaky hand on Bruce's shoulder and points at him.]\nTHOR: Don't you say that name.\n[Korg stands up and takes off his headphones]\nKORG: Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here.\nBRUCE BANNER: [quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor's hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you.\nTHOR: Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off.\n[Thor walks off screen]\nKORG: Umm... Stormbreaker?\nTHOR: Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?\nBRUCE BANNER: I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?\nTHOR: I don't know. Is it... Natasha?\nBRUCE BANNER: It was you. You helped me.\nTHOR: [walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway.\nBRUCE BANNER: I think we can bring them back.\nTHOR: Stop. Just, stop... [opens a packet on M&Ms] I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?\n[The camera cuts to Korg and Miek eating pizza and playing once more]\nKORG: Nah, all good here, mate!\n[Cuts back to Thor]\nTHOR: So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye.\nBRUCE BANNER: [from offscreen] We need you, pal.\n[Thor shakes his head and ignores Bruce.]\nROCKET: [Crossing his arms] There's beer on the ship.\nTHOR: [pauses, but doesn't look up] What kind?\n[SCREEN TITLE: TOKYO]\n[After seeing a Quinjet flown to the capital, the scene cuts to a nightclub in the city of Tokyo, as the entertainment still intact, loads of dead bodies of yakuza members are seen as a hooded figure throws a shuriken at another yakuza member firing at him. They are shouting something in Japanese, as two more men come out of nowhere and draw out their UZIs.]\nTHUG #1: \u3042\u3044\u3064\u3060! \u30a2\u30ad\u30d2\u30b3\u3055\u3093\u3092\uff01(Romanized: Aitsu da! Akihiko-san wo!) (Translated: It's him! He's after Akihiko!)\n[Both thugs fire their SMGs as both got slain by a shuriken. A yakuza member wielding a katana charges at him in the stairs, but is immediately overthrown and slain by the Ronin. Ronin then fights another sword-wielding thug, which is thrown outside the glass, killing him. The camera passes through two more buildings as the fighting ensues with different screams, shouts, more havoc inside, and gunfire. A man in a dark raincoat jumps through the glass window, with the Ronin doing the same, as both of them lands in a dark alleyway. The man in the raincoat turns to the Ronin, who just landed after him. It was Akihiko, the leader of a yakuza gang, whose head being hunted by the Ronin himself.]\nAKIHIKO: \u3066\u3081\u3048 \u306a\u305c\u3053\u3093\u306a\u3053\u3068\u3092\u3059\u308b? \u4ffa\u305f\u3061\u3066\u3081\u3048\u306b\u306a\u306b\u3082\u3057\u3066\u306d\u3047\u3060\u308d\uff01(Romanized: Tem\u0113 naze konna koto wo suru?

Omae wa naze buji nano...) (English: You survived... Half of the planet didn't. They got Thanos... you get me.)\n[Both sides engaged in combat as Ronin pierces his stomach, but doing only minor damage to him.]\nRONIN: [Also in Japanese] \u304a\u524d\u306f\u3082\u3046\u5341\u5206\u6bba\u3057\u305f\u3060\u308d(Romanized:Omae mo j\u016bbun korshita daro) You're done hurting people.\nAKIHIKO: [Japanese]\u4ffa\u3089\u304c\u3060\u3068? \u6c17\u3067\u3082\u72c2\u3063\u305f\u304b! (Orera ga dato? Ki demo kurutta ka!) [he gestures to all the scattered bodies of his henchmen] (English: WE hurt people? You're crazy!)\n[Akihiko charges, which Ronin immediately blocks. Both clang swords for two seconds, seeming that the yakuza leader has the upper hand, but Ronin punches him in the face, and sword-points him to his throat, in which Akihiko is temporarily petrified.]\n[He lowers down his sword as if he is about to surrender, but charges again at Ronin. Both swords clashed as Ronin slices his stomach, losing stamina, but gaining more strength from his rage.]\nAKIHIKO: [in a Gatotsu-like sword stance] \u6b7b\u306d! (Romanized: Shine!) (English: DIE!)\n[They both draw their katanas and the sword-fight continues. Ronin is clearly a better fighter, but Akihiko is also quite experienced. They clang swords, and for a second, it looks like Akihiko has the upper hand swinging at Ronin's neck. Ronin, however, ducks and slides under the katana, and slices Akihiko in the stomach as he slides past. Akihiko, now fatally injured, drops his katana.]\nAKIHIKO: \u5f85\u3066! \u52a9\u3051\u3066\u304f\u308c! \u304a\u524d\u306b\u4f55\u3067\u3082\u3084\u308b! \u4f55\u304c\u6b32\u3057\u3044?

You can't give me.\n[He thrusts the blade downwards into Akihiko's stomach. The body of the Japanese falls to the ground. Ronin grabs the sword, and wipes it on his gauntlet, ridding it of the blood of Akihiko. He notices someone behind him, and grabs his mask, and slides it off his head, revealing himself as Clint Barton, who has gone on a rampage since the decimation. He turns around and looks at Nat, who is standing behind him, holding an umbrella, and in casual clothes.]\nCLINT BARTON: You shouldn't be here.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Neither should you.\nCLINT BARTON: I've got a job to do.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.\n[Clint starts to look emotional, on the verge of crying.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: We found something. A chance, maybe...\nCLINT BARTON: [Now openly crying] Don't...\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Don't what?\nCLINT BARTON: ...don't give me hope.\nNATASHA: I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.\n[We cut to the Avenger's Compound, where we see Thor in a hoodie, drinking a beer and walking through the compound's Testing Chamber. Tony is also there, walking in from behind Thor.]\nTONY STARK: [To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who's working on something underneath a glass platform] Ratchet, How's it going?\nROCKET: It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.\n[Cut to a side room, where we see Scott, Bruce, Steve and Rhodey talking. Scott is in a white and red suit, similar to the Ant-Man suit.]\nRHODEY: Time travel suit? Not bad.\nSCOTT LANG: [Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!\nBRUCE BANNER: I'm being very careful.\nSCOTT LANG: No, you're being very Hulky.\nBRUCE BANNER: I'm being careful.\nSCOTT LANG: [Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more.\nRHODEY: Scott, calm down.\nSCOTT LANG: Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run.\n[Cut to the testing chamber, where we see Steve, Nat, Tony, Scott, Bruce, Rhodey and Nebula standing at a control panel, presumably controlling the glass platform.]\nSCOTT LANG: All right. I'm not ready for this.\nCLINT BARTON: I'm game. I'll do it.\n[Clint walks in wearing the suit Scott was moments before, the Quantum Suit.]\nBRUCE BANNER: Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it.\n[Clint taking position on the platform] \nRHODEY: Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and... [he makes a hand gesture suggesting that they strangle baby Thanos with a rope.]\nBRUCE BANNER: [Disgusted] First of all, that's horrible...\nRHODEY: [In a tone that says it's what we're all thinking.] It's Thanos.\nBRUCE BANNER: ...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future.\nSCOTT LANG: Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.\nCLINT BARTON: Bingo.\nNEBULA: That's not how it works.\nCLINT BARTON: Well, that's what I heard.\nBRUCE BANNER: What? By who? Who told you that?\nRHODEY: [counting with his fingers] Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -\nSCOTT LANG: Quantum Leap -\nRHODEY: A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -\nSCOTT LANG: Hot Tub Time Machine -\nRHODEY: Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.\nSCOTT LANG: Die Hard? No, it's not one...\nRHODEY: This is known.\nBRUCE BANNER: I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future...\nNEBULA: Exactly.\nSCOTT LANG: So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?\nBRUCE BANNER: [Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!\n[A helmet similar to Ant-Man's but white and more visible face pops on Clint's head, and he goes quantum. Clint flies through the quantum realm and into an opening. He grows back to normal size, but he's at a different place, and seemingly, time.]\n[Clint look around his family home, which unlike at the start of the movie, looks a lot more alive. The helmet pops off of Clint's head, and he looks around bewildered. He sees a baseball glove on the ground, presumably belonging to one of his sons, and picks it up. We hear a noise from inside the house, someone who Clint hasn't seen for five years.]\nLILA BARTON: Cooper? Where are my headphones?\nCLINT BARTON: [murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.]\n[We hear footsteps coming towards where Clint has just disappeared, and we see Lila coming down the stairs in Avril Lavigne-like clothing, looking around, puzzled]\nLILA BARTON: Dad? [She looks around] Dad?\n[Lila goes back upstairs, deciding that it was just nothing]\n[Cut to the Avengers Compound, we see Clint rematerialise on the glass platform, breathing heavily and sitting on the platform.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?\nCLINT BARTON: [Holding up the baseball glove and throw it to Stark] Yeah, it worked. It worked.\n[Scene cuts to the Avengers in a room with some hologram displays, showcasing each of the six Infinity Stones, sitting around a table. Tony, Steve and Bruce are pacing at the front, clearly leading the planning of the mission.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Okay, so the \"how\" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.\nTONY STARK: Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.\nSCOTT LANG: I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about\nBRUCE BANNER: Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.\nTONY STARK: Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.\nCLINT BARTON: Which means we have to pick our targets.\nTONY STARK: Correct.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?\n[We see Thor sitting on a chair with his sunglasses on. It is impossible to tell whether he is awake or asleep.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Is he asleep?\nRHODEY: No, I'm pretty sure he's dead.\n[Thor wakes up]\nTHOR: Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves... [He wiggles his fingers to imitate a spooky ghost] Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane, [An image of Jane Foster pops up on the screen] Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead, [Thor starts to look broken, and seems on the verge of tears] and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever, [Tony starts to push him back to his chair] I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence.\nTONY STARK: Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?\nTHOR: I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you.\n[Cut to the Avengers sitting around a table, eating a meal, and Rocket is pacing on the table in front of everyone.]\nROCKET: Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.\nSCOTT LANG: Is that a person?\nROCKET: Morag's a planet. Quill was a person.\nSCOTT LANG: A planet? Like in outer space?\nROCKET: Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. [Imitating talking to a puppy] Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll get you to space.\n[Cut to everyone facing Nebula in the planning room, and Nat writing notes for their plan.]\nNEBULA: Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: [In a business-like tone] What is Vormir?\nNEBULA: A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister.\n[Nat looks up, and an awkward silence falls upon the room. She writes what Nebula has just said, and Scott makes to break the awkward moment.]\nSCOTT LANG: Not it.\n[We see Tony and Nat lying on a table surrounded by papers, and Bruce lying down on the floor. The Time Stone pops up on the display.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: That Time Stone guy...\nBRUCE BANNER: Doctor Strange.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?\nTONY STARK: Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.\nBRUCE BANNER: Nice place in the village, though.\nTONY STARK: Yeah. Sullivan Street.\nBRUCE BANNER: Hmm... Bleecker.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Wait, he lived in New York?\nTONY STARK: No. He lived in Toronto.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.\nBRUCE BANNER: [Sitting up in surprise] Shut the front door.\n[Shot cuts to the holograms displaying the different location, the Soul and Power Stones in space in 2014. the Reality Stone in Asgard, 2013; and the Space, Mind, and Time Stones in New York City, 2012]\nSTEVE ROGERS: All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot.\n[He and the other Avengers walk up and look at the screens determinedly.]\n[The shot cuts to the Avengers walking in a file to the Quantum Time machine, wearing the Quantum Suits, albeit with some minor differences for different people. Rhodey has a bulkier repaint of the War machine armour. ]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win. [Tony gives Steve a look] Whatever it takes. Good luck.\nROCKET:[Refers to Steve's speaking] He's pretty good at that.\nSCOTT LANG: Right? [Looks very excited]\nTONY STARK: All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.\nBRUCE BANNER: Tractors engaged.\nROCKET: [Addressing the shrunk Benatar in Clint's hand] You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?\nCLINT BARTON: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best.\nROCKET: As promises go, that was pretty lame.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: [Smiling excitedly] See you in a minute.\n[They all shrink and enter the Quantum Realm, and they all split at different intervals, going to a different place at a different time in history.]\n[The First Group which has Tony, Steve, Bruce, & Scott; travels to New York in 2012. A previous stock shot of the Chitauri snarling and the iconic circle take around our six Original Avengers assembling before panning over to a side street where Scott, Steve, Banner and Tony materialise.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.\n[2012 Hulk passes by them, smashing everything in his way. Bruce puts his hand on his face, embarrassed.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Feel free to smash a few things along the way.\nBRUCE BANNER: I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.\n[Present Bruce pretends to smash things in a sarcastic way. He tears his shirt off, and walks over to a car. He lightly punches the car, making a small dent, all the while making growling noises. He picks up a motorbike and throws it at a wall, wincing as it hits the wall.]\n[Shot cuts to the Roof of the Sanctum Sanctorum where 2012 The Ancient One protects it. Bruce tries to enter through the roof before noticing her.]\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.\nBRUCE BANNER: Ma'am, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): You're about... five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about twenty blocks that way. What do you want from him?\nBRUCE BANNER: That, actually.\n[He points towards the Eye of Agamotto where the Time Stone is kept]\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Ah! I'm afraid not.\nBRUCE BANNER: Sorry, but I wasn't asking.\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): You don't wanna do this.\nBRUCE BANNER: Ah, you're right, I don't. [He makes a grab at the Eye of Agamotto] But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it-\n[The Ancient One (2012) pushes Bruce' astral form out of his body. Bruce who's is now in astral form looks at The Ancient One horrified.]\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Let's start over, shall we?\n[Cut to an aerial shot of Asgard in 2013.Then to the prison in Asgard, where we see the Loki from The Dark World, sitting in his cell. Without him noticing, Rocket and Thor creep by, past the cell. They stop at a pillar a few metres away room of where Jane Foster is]\nTHOR: That's Jane.\nROCKET: All right. Here's the deal, Tubby: You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing, [He holds up a device.] and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split.\nTHOR: I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to fish huge barrel of ale. I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...\nROCKET: Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?\n[A door opens, Thor and Rocket both try to hide. We then see ladies along with Frigga (2013) walking. Thor sees his mother.]\nROCKET: Who's the fancy broad?\nTHOR: It's my Mother. She dies today.\nROCKET: Oh. That's today?\nTHOR: I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea.\nROCKET: Come here. [Standing in front of him]\nTHOR: No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad-\nROCKET: Come here. Right here.\n[Rocket slaps Thor.]\nROCKET: You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?\nTHOR: Okay.\nROCKET: Are you crying?\nTHOR: No...Yes!\nROCKET: Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?\nTHOR: Yes, I can.\nROCKET: Good.\nTHOR: I can do this. I can do it, I can't do this.\n[Thor runs away.]\nROCKET: Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot. [He turns back to where Thor was moments ago] Thor? Thor!\n[Cut to Morag in 2014, where we see Rhodey getting off the Benatar as it lands.]\nRHODEY: Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.\nCLINT BARTON: Hey, can we hurry it up?\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock.\n[Nebula walks out of the ship, apparently having directed it to its next destination.\nRHODEY: All that, is really helpful. [Hugging Natasha] Take care, okay?\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah.\nRHODEY: Take that stone and come back. No messing around.\nCLINT BARTON: [To Rhodey] Hey. You got this.\nRHODEY: Let's get it done. Yes, sir.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: [Walking with Clint back into the ship] See you back.\nRHODEY: You guys watch each other's six.\n[Clint and Nat look back and just smile.]\nCLINT BARTON: Yeah.\n[They walk back into the ship, and the hatch closes. The ship takes off and speeds out of the atmosphere of Morag.]\nNEBULA: The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.\n[In the Benatar, Clint and Nat are sitting at the front of the ship. The ship takes a jump through space and speeds up tremendously. Nat and Clint look at each other.]\nCLINT BARTON: We're a long way from Budapest.\n[Natasha just laughs.]\n[Back to Morag, where Rhodey and Nebula are standing where we left them.]\nRHODEY: Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?\nNEBULA: [Looking around] Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.\nRHODEY: Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?\nNEBULA: My father, my sister... and me.\nRHODEY: And you? Where are you right now?\n[Cuts to a scene of Gamora (2014) and Nebula (2014) fighting some intergalactic creatures.]\nGAMORA (2014): [Helping Nebula up] You're welcome.\nNEBULA (2014): I didn't ask for your help.\nGAMORA (2014): And yet, you always need it. Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.\nNEBULA (2014): Why?\nGAMORA (2014): He's found an Infinity Stone.\nNEBULA (2014): Where?\nGAMORA (2014): On a planet called Morag.\nNEBULA (2014): Father's plan is finally in motion.\nGAMORA (2014): One stone isn't six, Nebula.\nNEBULA (2014): It\u2019s a start.\nGAMORA (2014): If he gets all of them...\n[Thanos (2014) arrives, honking badass double-bladed sword in tow and healthy coating blood of his armour.]\nTHANOS (2014): Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.\nGAMORA (2014): He won't like that.\nTHANOS (2014): His alternative is death, then. [Thanos wipes his double-bladed sword] Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement.\nNEBULA (2014): We will not fail you, Father.\n[Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes]\nTHANOS (2014): No, you won't.\nNEBULA (2014): I swear...I will make you proud.\n[Nebula (2014) is suddenly in pain and opens up future Nebula's memories.]\nRHODEY (Memory): We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?\nNEBULA (Memory): Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.\n[Nebula (2014) shuts off the memory]\nGAMORA (2014): Who was that?\nNEBULA (2014): I don't know...My head is splitting...I don't know...\nGAMORA (2014): Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.\n[Thanos walks towards Nebula and brings his blade to her throat.]\nTHANOS (2014): Ssshhh... (pointing to Nebula) Bring her to my ship.\n[Cut to present Tony Stark flying around Stark Tower in the Mark 85. He scans the interior of the tower, and sees the original Avengers apprehending Loki, the backside of the iconic shot of Hawkeye pointing the bow at Loki's face while the Avengers surround him.]\nTONY STARK: Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.\n[Cut to Steve in Stark Tower, walking towards the elevator.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.\nLOKI (2012): If it's all the same to you... I'll have that drink now.\nTONY STARK (2012): All right. Good one. No standing around, I'm closing up this door for later. [To 2012 Cap] By the way, feel free to clean up.\nTONY STARK: Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit [A shot of Cap walking around in his 2012 suit] did nothing for your ass.\nSTEVE ROGERS: No one asked you to look, Tony.\nTONY STARK: [whispers] It's ridiculous\nSCOTT LANG: I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. [Does a patriotic salute.]\nNATASHA ROMANOFF (2012): Uhh, magic wand?\nTONY STARK (2012): STRIKE team's coming to secure it.\n[A Hydra team including Rumlow and Sitwell enter, known at this time as a part of SHIELD.]\nSITWELL (2012): We can take that [Taking Loki's Scepter from 2012 Natasha] off your hands.\nNATASHA ROMANOFF (2012): By all means. Careful with that thing.\nCLINT BARTON (2012): Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way.\nSITWELL (2012): We promise to be careful.\nSCOTT LANG: Who are these guys?\nTONY STARK: They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet.\nSCOTT LANG: Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys.\nTONY STARK: You're small, but you're talking loud.\nSTEVE ROGERS (2012): On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.\nLOKI (2012): [Transforming into Steve for a second in imitation] On my way down to coordinate search and rescue! [Transforming back] I mean, honestly! How do you think you'll be...\nTHOR (2012): [Slapping on a device on Loki's mouth to make him quiet] Shut up.\nTONY STARK: All right, you're up, little buddy. [Looking at the briefcase with the Tesseract] There's our stone.\nSCOTT LANG: [Lying down on Tony's shoulder] Alright. Flick me.\n[Tony flicks Scott onto his 2012 self, right into his beard. 2012 Tony then scratches his beard, dropping present Scott onto 2012 Tony's reactor.] \n[All of the 2012 Avengers get in an elevator. Hulk makes to follow, but finds the elevator full.]\nTHOR (2012): Whoa!\nTONY STARK (2012): Whoa, whoa. Hey! Buddy. What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.\nTHOR (2012 ): Take the stairs.\nTONY STARK (2012): Yeah. [Hulk draws his fist back right as the elevator door closes] Stop. Stop!\n[He follows through with the punch, making a dent in the wall right where the door was.]\nHULK (2012): [Pissed] Take the stairs! Take the stairs!\nTONY STARK: All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.\nSTEVE ROGERS: On it. Head to the lobby.\nTONY STARK: Alright. I'll see you there.\n[scene cuts to HYDRA agents in the elevator]\nSITWELL (2012): Evidence secure. We're en route to Dr. List. No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.\n[Elevator opens and HYDRA agents sees Steve. Steve walks in and hits the button to continue down.]\nSITWELL (2012): Captain. I thought you were coordinating search and rescue?\nSTEVE ROGERS: Change of plans.\nRUMLOW (2012): Hey, Cap.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Rumlow. [everyone starts getting suspicious and has their guard up] I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.\nSITWELL (2012): Sir? I don't understand.\nSTEVE ROGERS: We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.\nRUMLOW (2012): Sorry, Cap. I can't give you the scepter.\nSITWELL (2012): I'm gonna have to call the Director.\nSTEVE ROGERS: That's okay. Trust me. [Steve leans over to Sitwell's ear.] Hail Hydra.\n[Everyone is surprised, Steve walks out of the elevator with the scepter and a smile.]\n[Cut to the building's stairwell. The Hulk looks down at the many stairs below him.]\nHULK (2012): [Angrily] So many stairs!\n[Cut to the lobby. The 2012 Avengers start to make their way out of the building.

Now.\nALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): May I ask you where you're going?\nTHOR (2012): To lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are?\nTONY STARK (2012): Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury.\nALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.\nTHOR (2012): Loki will be answering to Odin himself.\nALEXANDER PEIRCE (2012): Oh, he's gonna answer to us. Odin can have what's left. And I'm gonna need that case, that's been SHIELD property for over 70 years.\nHYDRA AGENT: Hand over the case, Stark.\nTONY STARK: [To present Scott through radio] All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go.\nTONY STARK(2012): I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here, all right?\nSCOTT LANG: You promise me you won't die?\nTONY STARK: You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.\nSCOTT LANG: That doesn't sound mild.\nALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): I need the case.\nTONY STARK (2012): I know you got a lotta pull. I'm just saying...\nALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Okay. Then give me the case.\nTONY STARK: Do it, Lang!\nTONY STARK (2012): Get your hands off!\nTONY STARK: Window's closing. Pull my pin!\nSCOTT LANG: Here goes!\n[Ant-Man pulls off Stark 2012's reactor, and Tony (2012) drops the case]\nALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Stark? Stark!\n[Stark 2012 falls down to the ground]\nALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Look, he's convulsing. Give him air! Medic!\nTONY STARK: MEDIC! You guys, some help!\nALEXANDER PIERCE (2012): Stark, you--- your chest machine?\n[Ant-Man pushes the case, Loki looks at case, Tony Stark grabs the case.]\nTONY STARK: Good job.

Stay with us! I'll try something, okay? I have no idea if it's gonna work.\n[Thor 2012 uses the Mjolnir as the defibrillator on Tony Stark 2012]\nTHOR (2012): YES!\nTONY STARK (2012): That worked a treat. That was so crazy!\nTHOR (2012): I had no idea if that was gonna work.\nTONY STARK (2012): The case?\nTHOR (2012): The case. It's, uhh... Where's the case? Where's Loki? Loki!\nSCOTT LANG: That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?\nTONY STARK: Oh, we blew it.\nTHOR (2012): Loki!\n[Cut to a walkway several floors up.

I know.\n[Both Rogers' frisbee their shield's at one another which clang away as they brawl, inadvertently kicking away the case containing the scepter which falls down a few levels. 2012 Steve gets the upper hand on Future Steve's as they both fall down to the same level as the scepter.

Bruce Banner tries reasoning with the Ancient One to let him have the Time Stone.]\nBRUCE BANNER: Please, please!\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I'm dooming my own.\nBRUCE BANNER: With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that.\n[The Ancient One creates a projection with a long ray that simulates the flow of time.]\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits. [Shows black stream indicating a point of divergence] Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one\u2026not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor, can your science prevent all that?\nBRUCE BANNER: No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, in that reality, it never left.\n[Bruce's astral form takes the projection of the removed Time Stone, replaces it back amongst the other five, and the doomed alternate dimension fades away, illustrating his point.]\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [still not convinced.] But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive.\nBRUCE BANNER: We will. I will. I promise.\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I can't risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.\nBRUCE BANNER: Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): [Surprised] What did you say?\nBRUCE BANNER: Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Willingly?\nBRUCE BANNER: Yes.\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): ...Why?\nBRUCE BANNER: I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): Or I did. [She returns to Banner control of his Hulk body and opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone] Strange is meant to be the best of us.\nBRUCE BANNER: So he must have done it for a reason.\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I fear you might be right. [gives him the Time Stone]\nBRUCE BANNER: Thank you.\nTHE ANCIENT ONE (2012): I'm counting on you, Bruce. We all are.\n[Cut to Thanos (2014), Nebula (2014), Gamora (2014) and Ebony Maw (2014) on the Sanctuary II.]\nTHANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw] Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file.\nEBONY MAW (2014): Sire, the file appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There's another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula.\nTHANOS (2014): Impossible.\nEBONY MAW (2014): This duplicate carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future.\nTHANOS (2014): Where is this other Nebula?\nEBONY MAW (2014): In our solar system. On Morag.\nTHANOS (2014): Can you access her?\nEBONY MAW (2014): Yes. The two are linked.\nTHANOS (2014): Search the duplicate's memories for Infinity Stones.\n[Memory of the meeting with all the Avengers starts playing]\nSTEVE ROGERS (2023): And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.\nTONY STARK (2023): Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.\nCLINT BARTON (2023): Which means we have to pick our targets.\nTONY STARK (2023): Correct.\n[End memory.]\nTHANOS (2014): [To Ebony Maw] Freeze image.\nGAMORA (2014): Terrans.\nTHANOS (2014): Avengers. Unruly wretches. What's that reflection? Amplify this, Maw.\nGAMORA (2014): [Looking at a reflection of Nebula (2023)] I don't understand. Two Nebulas.\nTHANOS (2014): No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything.\n[Cut back to Thor and Rocket in Asgard, 2013]\nFRIGGA (2013): My ladies, I'll see you after.

This is one of my favorites.\n[Frigga puts her hand on Thor's face and takes a good look at him}\nFRIGGA (2013): What's wrong with your eye?\nTHOR: Oh, my eye.

I see with more than eyes, and you know that.\n[Thor attempts to hold back his tears and fails miserably.]\nTHOR: I am totally, totally from the future!\nFRIGGA (2013): Yes, you are.\nTHOR: I really need to talk to you.\nFRIGGA (2013): We can talk.\n[They both hug each other.]\n[Scene cuts to Jane Foster waking up while Rocket sneaks behind her to extract the Aether] \n[Scene cuts back to Thor and Frigga's conversation.]\nTHOR: His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.\nFRIGGA (2013): You're no idiot. You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.\nTHOR: I guess, yeah.\nFRIGGA (2013): Idiot? No. A failure? Absolutely.\nTHOR: That's a little bit harsh.\nFRIGGA (2013): You do know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.\nTHOR: I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?\nFRIGGA (2013): Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.\nTHOR: I really missed you, Mum.\n[scene cuts to Rocket running away from the Asgardian soldiers]\nROCKET: Thor! I got it!\nASGARDIAN SOLDIER (2013): Get that rabbit!\nTHOR: Ma, I have to tell you something.\nFRIGGA (2013): No, son. You don't.

Come on, we got to move.\nTHOR: I wish we had more time.\nFRIGGA (2013): No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be.\nTHOR: I love you, Mom.\nFRIGGA (2013): I love you.

I am inevitable.\n[Memory pauses.]\nGAMORA (2014): What did you do to them?\nTHANOS (2014): Nothing. Yet. They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time.

The shot shows her body on the ground, dead. A boom in the sky sends Clint in a pool of water with the Soul Stone in his hand. He hits the ground out of anger. His Quantum Suit activates and he shrinks back to the present day, soon joined by the others returning from their journeys.]\n[Cut to the Avengers HQ and the Quantum platform everyone looks around to see all the recovered stones]\nBRUCE BANNER: \nDid we get them all?\nRHODEY: You telling me this'll\nactually work?\n[There's a pause as everyone starts to realise someone is missing]\nBRUCE BANNER: \nClint, where's Nat?\n[The silence from Clint tells them all they need to know. The mission was completed but at a dire cost. Sadness overtakes everyone. Bruce falls to his knees and pounds the floor in grief.]\n[Cut to outside HQ. Lakeside, Tony, Steve, Thor, Clint, and Bruce are mourning their fallen teammate and friend]\nTONY STARK: Do we know if she had family?\nSTEVE ROGERS: Yeah. Us.\nTHOR: (confused) What?\nTONY STARK: I just asked him a question...\nTHOR: Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right? [GROWLING.] So stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together.\nCLINT BARTON: We can't get her back.\nTHOR: Wha- what?\nCLINT BARTON: It can't be undone. It can't.\n[Thor dryly laughs.]\nTHOR: I'm sorry. No offense, but you're\na very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And \"can't\" seems very definitive don't you think?\nCLINT BARTON: (to Thor) Look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?\nTHOR: Now that's my point...\nCLINT BARTON: It can't... be undone. Or that's at least what the, great floating guy had to say. (shouts) Maybe you wanna go talk to him? Okay? Go grab your hammer, and you go fly and you talk to him.\n[Clint's anger is quickly replaced with grief]\nCLINT BARTON: It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that\ngoddamned stone. She bet her life on it.\n[In a burst of anger, Bruce grabs a bench and hurls it clear across the lake. His anger spent, he turns to the others with a resigned look on his face]\nBRUCE BANNER: She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.\nSTEVE ROGERS: We will.\n[Cut to inside the Avenger's Lab. Tony carefully places the stones in the gauntlet he made while Bruce and Rocket watches. With nervous precision, Tony manipulates the machine and carefully places all six stones into the gauntlet]\nROCKET: Boom!\n[Tony and Bruce jump a bit, and quickly groan at Rocket's joke. Scene cuts to another room with the new finished gauntlet. Everyone is gathered around it.]\nROCKET: All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?\nTHOR: I'll do it.\nSCOTT LANG: Excuse me?\nTHOR: It's okay.\nEVERYONE: (holding up Thor) No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey...\nSTEVE ROGERS: Wait, wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's\ngonna put that on yet.\nTHOR:\nI'm sorry. What, we're just sitting\naround waiting for the right opportunity?\nSCOTT LANG: We should at least discuss it.\nTHOR: No, no, sitting here staring at that\nthing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty.\nTONY STARK: It's not that...\nTHOR: (hushes everyone up) It's... stop it! Just let me. (he tears up) Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something great.\nTONY STARK\u00a0: Look...It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition.\nTHOR: What do you think is coursing\nthrough my veins right now?\nRHODEY: Cheez Whiz?\nTHOR: Lightning.\nTONY STARK: Yeah.\nBRUCE: Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me.\n[Thor lets go of Tony]\nBRUCE BANNER: You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.\nSTEVE ROGERS: How do we know you will?\nBRUCE BANNER: We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma. [He takes a good look at the gauntlet] It's like...uh...I was made for this.\n[Nebula (2014) sneaks off to the Quantum portal and activates it]\nTONY STARK: Good to go, yeah?\nBRUCE BANNER: Let's do it.\nTONY STARK: You remember... everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.\nBRUCE BANNER: Got it.\n[Everyone gets ready and suits up]\nTONY STARK: F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Protocol 8.\nF.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yes, boss.\n[Avengers facility goes on lockdown]\nBRUCE BANNER: Everybody comes home.\n[Bruce puts on the gauntlet, which nanobotically expands to fit his hand, and the power surge overwhelms him. He grunts in pain.]\nTHOR: Take it off. Take it off!\nSTEVE ROGERS: No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?\nTONY STARK: Talk to me, Banner.\nBRUCE BANNER: I'm okay. I'm okay.\n[Thor gives a double thumbs up, scene cuts to Nebula (2014) opening the Quantum Tunnel and brings the Sanctuary II to the present.]\n[Bruce screams, fighting through the intense pain coursing through his body courtesy of the gauntlet, and manages to snap his fingers. He faints and the gauntlet slides off his arm, Clint kicks it away]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Bruce!\nTONY STARK: Don't move him.\nBRUCE ROGERS: [Bruce holds onto Steve's arm] Did it work?\nTHOR: Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.\n[Scott walks towards the outside windows and sees plants and birds. Clint hears his phone ringing and sees it's his wife calling]\nCLINT BARTON: (struggling to speak from sheer happiness) Honey. Honey.\nSCOTT LANG: Guys...I think it worked!\n[Bruce opens his eyes and sees the Sanctuary II up in the sky and a single missile heading towards the base blowing away Scott away. Then a continuous array of missiles destroys the base completely and everyone sinks below to the underground.]\n[The camera pans over to see Bruce holding up tons of debris from collapsing on top of the other Avengers with his one good arm. Some debris is stuck on top of Rocket.]\nROCKET: I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe.\nRHODEY: Canopy. Canopy. Canopy. [Rhodey gets out of his damaged suit]\nBRUCE BANNER: Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!\n[Rhodey crawls over to help Rocket while taking a rebar as leverage to lift the debris off Rocket]\nROCKET: Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!\n[Rhodey gets Rocket out and they both sigh in relief]\nBRUCE BANNER: Rhodey!\n[A flood engulfs both Rhodey and Rocket]\n[Scene cuts to Scott who survives the blast by shrinking.]\nRHODEY: Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding!\nSCOTT LANG: What?\nRHODEY: We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!\nSCOTT LANG: Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me?\n[Scene cuts to Clint in the sewer system and trying to get his bearings. He flashes a light upwards to see what happened.]\nCLINT BARTON: Cap?\n[Clint finds the gauntlet is with him but senses he's not alone down there. He shoots an arrow with light towards the dark tunnel and finds hordes of Outriders.]\nCLINT: [under his breath] Damn.\n[Clint takes the gauntlet and runs towards the opposite direction while the Outriders chase after him.]\n[Scene cuts to the Sanctuary II and it beams Thanos (2014) fully armoured to the ground. Nebula walks towards him.]\nTHANOS (2014): Daughter.\nNEBULA (2014): Yes, Father. So, this is the future. Well done.\n[Nebula (2014) takes off the orange plate on her head and throws it away]\nNEBULA (2014): Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.\n[Thanos (2014) plants his double-bladed sword on the ground, takes off his helmet and places on top of the sword's edge.]\nTHANOS (2014): The arrogant never do.\n[Thanos then sits down]\nTHANOS (2014): Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.\nNEBULA (2014): What will you do?\nTHANOS (2014): Wait.\n[Nebula (2014) proceeds to go find the stones and the camera pans over the Sanctuary II and we see Gamora (2014) watching. Gamora (2014) heads over to where Nebula is being held prisoner.]\nGAMORA (2014): Tell me something. In the future, what happens to you and me?\nNEBULA: I tried to kill you. Several times.\n[Gamora (2014) rolls her eyes]\nNEBULA: But eventually,\nwe become friends. We become sisters.\n[Gamora (2014) holds out her hand.]\nGAMORA (2014): \nCome on. We can stop him.\n[Nebula takes it]\n[Scene cuts to Tony walking towards Steve who's unconscious on the ground.]\nTONY STARK: Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. [He has Cap's shield.]You lose this again, I'm keeping it.\nSTEVE ROGERS: What happened?\nTONY STARK: We messed with time.\nIt tends to mess back. You'll see.\n[Tony helps Steve on his feet. They walk up to join Thor, who has been observing Thanos (2014) from a distance.] \nTONY STARK: What's he been doing?\nTHOR: Absolutely nothing.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Where are the stones?\nTONY STARK: Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.\nSTEVE ROGERS: So we keep it that way.\nTHOR: You know it's a trap, right?\nTONY STARK: Yeah. And I don't much care.\nTHOR: Good. Just as long we are all in agreement. [Thunder cracks as Thor stretches out both hands to summon both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir (2013). His casual clothes transform into his armour and cape, with his beard getting some braid treatment.] Let's kill him properly this time.\n[The Big Three walk over to confront Thanos face to face]\nTHANOS (2014): You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you\u2019ve shown me that\u2019s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.\nTONY STARK: Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.\nTHANOS (2014): I'm thankful. Because now, I know\nwhat I must do. [stands up] I will shred this universe\ndown to its last atom. [Thanos (2014) puts on his helmet] And then...With the stones you've collected\nfor me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost\nbut only what it has been given. [Thor lights himself up.] A grateful universe.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Born out of blood.\nTHANOS (2014): They'll never know it. Because you won't be\nalive to tell them.\n[The fighting starts, and Thor and Tony go straight at Thanos (2014). Meanwhile, Hulk is under all of the mess trying to hold up the structure. Rhodey and Rocket are breathing for their lives.]\nRHODEY: See you on the other side, man.\nSCOTT LANG: Hang on! I'm coming!\n[Hawkeye is running with the infinity gauntlet. He blows the place, and escapes before the Outriders overwhelm him. He sees Nebula (2014).]\nCLINT BARTON: Oh, hey...I know you.\nNEBULA (2014): Father. I have the stones.\nCLINT BARTON: What?!\n[Gamora (2014) and Nebula come around the corner]\nGAMORA (2014): Stop.\nNEBULA (2014): You're betraying us?\nNEBULA: You don't have to do this.\nNEBULA (2014): I am... this.\nGAMORA (2014): No, you're not.\nNEBULA: You've seen what we become.\nGAMORA (2014): Nebula, listen to her.\nNEBULA: You can change.\nNEBULA (2014): He won't let me.\n[Nebula (2014) points a gun at Gamora (2014)]\nGAMORA (2014): No!\n[Present Nebula shoots Nebula (2014) and she dies. Hawkeye picks up the Infinity Gauntlet]\nTONY STARK: Okay, Thor. Hit me.\n[Thor bangs his 2 hammers together combined with his lightning. Tony's suit sucks up the energy and he shoots it out using his hands and his body. Thanos twirls his blade really fast to divert the energy. Thor grabs Stormbreaker and uses it to bat Mj\u00f6lnir to hit Thanos. Thanos uses Tony as a shield resulting in damage to his system.]\nF.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, wake up.\n[Steve tries to attack Thanos but is easily shielded away by the Mad Titan. Thor's attack on Thanos is blocked by his sword. Thor is beaten and choked by Thanos, as he punches him. Mjolnir is flicked away as Thanos relentlessly beats up Thor, throwing him into a tree and socking him before throwing him over rubble and socking him again. Thor tries to grab Stormbreaker but Thanos grabs it and uses it against Thor as he tries to defend himself. Mj\u00f6lnir (2013) starts to float off the ground while Thanos is digging it into Thor, when suddenly Mjolnir flies into Thanos, zooms past, stops, and flies back, both look on in amazement as Steve picks up the hammer.]\nTHOR: I knew it!\n[Thanos' (2014) kicks Thor to the ground and proceed to battle Steve dual wielding both his shield and Mjolnir (2013)]\n[Steve proceeds to charge at Thanos swinging Mjolnir (2013) and hitting Thanos in the face knocking him down. Steve throws his shield and Thanos (2014) deflects, Steve throws Mjolnir (2013) to his shield creating a shockwave and knocking Thanos (2014) off his feet. Steve goes on the offensive on Thanos, throwing his shield first at Thanos and quickly hitting it back at him again with Mjolnir. He lines his arm back up and underarms a channel of lightning on Thanos.]\n[Thanos eventually gets the upper hand, he removes his helmet, stabs Steve on the leg and knocks Mjolnir (2013) out of his hand. Thanos proceed to destroy Steve's shield with his double-bladed sword and throws him across the battlefield.]\n[Steve staggeredly tries to get up.]\nTHANOS (2014): In all my years of conquest...violence...slaughter... It was never personal. But I'll tell you now... what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet... I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.\n[Thanos' (2014) entire army is summons to the ground which include the Children of Thanos, Chitauri, Outriders. Upon seeing the army descending on Earth, Steve slowly gets back to his feet. With a fierce determination, he tightens his broken shield to his arm and stands against Thanos' giant army alone. Suddenly, a crackling comes in on his communicator.]\nSAM WILSON: Cap, you hear me?\n[Steve stops and looks around] \nSAM WILSON: Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?\n[A yellow portal begins to form behind him.]\nSAM WILSON: On your left.\n[Steve looks behind to see the portal on his left side. Three figures step through; Okoye, Shuri, and Black Panther, fully restored and ready to fight. Steve and the revived Wakandans share a look when Sam zooms in from above in his Falcon armor. As he does, we see dozens more portals opening up all around the battlefield. Through one of these, we see Doctor Strange descend in. He is joined by Drax, Mantis, Star Lord, and Spider-Man. Everyone watches in confusion and awe as more and more heroes arrive from all corners of the universe, all backed up with forces of their own including Black Panther and his Wakandan army, Valkyrie and the Asgardians, Wong and the Masters of the Mystic Arts and several Ravager ships. Amongst the throngs of heroes we see Bucky, Groot, the Scarlet Witch, the Wasp, and Pepper Potts (clad in her own iron suit) arrive. Nearly every hero has magically been transported to the battlefield to face Thanos' hordes.]\nDOCTOR STRANGE: Is that everyone?\nWONG: What, you wanted more?\n[Giant-Man emerges from the rubble of the Avengers facility with Professor Hulk, War Machine, and Rocket. The Avengers, Guardians, Wakandans, Asgardians, and Ravagers take up battle positions. The heroes standing across Thanos' forces.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: AVENGERS! [he summons Mjolnir]......assemble.\n[Thor makes a battle cry, as does Black Panther and the heroes charge, the Avengers theme swelling with their stride. Thanos raises his sword towards them, commanding his army to charge as well. Then both sides collide. The camera switches between the meet-line, Drax and Korg, Pepper and Tony, all which are battling against Thanos' army.]\n[Cuts to Steve and Thor fighting. Steve takes Stormbreaker but Thor flies to him and passes Mjolnir]\nTHOR: No, no, give me that. You have the little one.\n[Later, Tony Stark is seen fighting some of Thanos' army. But Cull Obsidian punches him to the ground, then Giant-Man stomps him flat and Peter Parker runs to Tony.]\nPETER PARKER: Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, \"It's been five years. Come on, they need us.\" And then he started doing the yellow\nsparkly thing that he does all the time. What are you doing?\n[Tony hugs Peter, making him shocked, but he hugs Tony back.]\nPETER PARKER: Oh, this is nice.\n[Cut to Star-Lord Fighting a bunch of Sakaarans, killing all of them except one, which makes him fall over, but a off-screen shot kills him and he drops on Peter. Peter gets up and sees Gamora (2014). Thinking its present Gamora, he is shocked.]\nPETER QUILL: Gamora? [Peter slowly approaches Gamora(2014)] I thought I lost you.\n[Peter touches Gamora's hair, not knowing she isn't present Gamora. In response, Gamora (2014) grabs Peter's hand firmly off her hair.]\nPETER QUILL: Ow...\nGAMORA (2014): [Kicks Peter in the nuts, slightly hurting Peter] Don't...you touch...[Kicks him again, this time harder] me!\n[Peter falls from the pain, while Gamora (2014) wipes her face.]\nPETER QUILL: You missed the first time... Then you got them both the second time.\nGAMORA (2014): [to Nebula] This is the one? Seriously?\nNEBULA: The choices were him, or a tree.\n[Peter pointing to Gamora (2014) in confusion, then to Nebula in question, and then back to Gamora (2014).]\n[Later, Clint is seen running with the gauntlet]\nCLINT BARTON: Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?\nSTEVE ROGERS: Get those stones as far away as possible!\nBRUCE BANNER: No! We need to get them back where they came from.\nTONY STARK: No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.\nSCOTT LANG: Hold on! [Scott shrinks to normal size and pulls out a remote.] That wasn't our only time machine.\n[Scott presses the button, which activates Luis's van's Horn, which is heard from afar. Hearing so, Cap goes to higher ground.]\nSTEVE ROGERS: Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?\nVALKYRIE: Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked.\nTONY STARK: Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?\nSCOTT LANG: Maybe ten minutes.\nSTEVE ROGERS: Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.\nHOPE DYNE: We're on it, Cap.\n[Scott and Hope share a look and they shrink. Scott grabs Hope, and they fly to the van. Doctor Strange traps a group of Chitauri in his magic and sends them through portals as Tony joins him.]\nTONY STARK: Hey. You said one out of 14\nmillion, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.\nDOCTOR STRANGE: If I tell you what happens, it won't happen.\nTONY STARK: You better be right.\n[Cut to Scott and Hope entering a small hole in the van's window, getting to the drive seat, regrowing and trying to activate the Quantum Tunnel.]\nTHE WASP: It's a mess back here.\nSCOTT LANG: It's... it's dead.\nTHE WASP: What?\nSCOTT LANG: It's dead. I have to hotwire it.\nTHANOS: Where's Nebula?\nCORVUS GLAIVE: She's not responding.\nEBONY MAW (2014): [pointing.] Sire!\n[Thanos sees the gauntlet. Clint rushes through Outriders, before finding himself surrounded. He is saved by Black Panther.] \nT'CHALLA: Clint! Give it to me.\n[Clint gives T'Challa the Gauntlet to T'Challa, and he runs towards the van while fighting Thanos' army. Eventually he is stopped by the double edged sword, boomeranged by Thanos. When it gets back to him, he charges T'Challa, but stopped by Wanda, which is filled with anger for the loss of Vision.]\nWANDA MAXIMOFF: You took everything from me.\nTHANOS (2014): I don't even know who you are.\nWANDA MAXIMOFF: You will.\n[With her powers, Wanda picks up some debris on the ground and tries to crush Thanos with it.]\nPETER PARKER: I got it! Activate Instant Kill!\nTHANOS (2014): Rain fire!\nCORVUS GLAIVE: But Sire, our troops!\nTHANOS (2014): Just do it!\nPEPPER POTTS: Uh, is anyone else seeing this?\nPETER PARKER: I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help!\nSTEVE: Hey, Queens. Heads up.\n[Steve throws Mjolnir, and Peter shoots a web and glides along, then Pepper Potts catches him]\nPEPPER POTTS: Hang on. I got you, kid. [She drops him on Valkyrie's Pegasus]\nPETER PARKER: Hey! Nice to meet you--- Oh, my God!\n[The cannons knock Peter Parker off the Pegasus, then they turn to face something in the sky as all the cannons start shooting at something.]\nSAM: What the hell is this?\nTONY STARK: F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?\nF.R.I.D.A.Y.: Something just entered the upper atmosphere.\n[A bright light of thundering energy comes surging down as Carol Danvers flies through the ship, and it results in an explosion and the ship crash-landing in the lake]\nROCKET: Oh, yeah!\nSTEVE ROGERS: Danvers, we need an assist here.\n[Cut to Scott finally activating the Quantum Tunnel. Then cut to Carol Danvers landing near Peter, who is on the ground, weirdly hugging the gauntlet with his body.]\nPETER PARKER: Hi. I'm Peter Parker.\nCAROL DANVERS: Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?\nPETER PARKER: [Gets up and passes her the gauntlet] I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that.\n[Wanda arrives, Valkyrie flying on her Pegasus as she arrives.]\nWANDA MAXIMOFF: Don't worry.\nOKOYE: She's got help.\n[Pepper lands next to Okoye, followed by Mantis and Shuri, the Wasp, 2014 Gamora and Nebula. Thanos' army charges while the women help Carol Danvers go through the Outriders and Chitauri. 2014 Gamora takes out a gorilla, while Okoye takes out Corvus Glaive. Wanda and Valkyrie destroy two leviathans. Carol Danvers then starts flying towards the van with the Gauntlet, flying past enemies and going through enemy blockades that are in her way with ease. Thanos, seeing this, starts running to Carol Danvers, but is stopped by Pepper, Shuri and The Wasp, who blast him backwards. Thanos, after seeing Carol Danvers fly past him, throws his double sword at the van, destroying it and the quantum realm tunnel, throwing Carol Danvers backwards and losing her grip on the Gauntlet, which falls to the ground. Doctor Strange steadies the water after the explosion. In the final brawl for the Stark Gauntlet, Stark moves one of Thanos' enemies aside and sees the Gauntlet. He runs to get it, but sees Thanos, who Stark tackles. Thanos smacks Stark away, knocking him out. Then Thor arrives with Stormbreaker and 2013 Mjolnir in an attempt to pin Thanos' arm down, with assistance from Captain America. However, Thanos overpowers them and knocks them both out. After picking up the Gauntlet, Carol Danvers arrives, punching away at Thanos while he is holding the Gauntlet. She keeps punching him, but Thanos grabs her by the arm and flings her away. Thanos puts on the gauntlet, gamma radiation from the stones eating at him as he tries to snap, but Carol Danvers arises again, and stops his fingers from snapping, opening up his hand similar to what Captain America did in Avengers: Infinity War. Thanos headbutts her, but it does nothing. Just as Carol Danvers is gaining the upper hand by rising up and forcing Thanos onto his knees, Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Carol Danvers away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Or is it? Stark nods. Thanos puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, yelling from the gamma radiation coursing through him, until Stark makes one last attack on Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away.]\nTHANOS (2014): I am... inevitable.\n[Thanos snaps his fingers, but nothing happens except a metallic \"clink.\" He sees the Infinity Stones are missing. Tony has the stones on his own gauntlet, the gamma radiation coursing through him, to Thanos' shock.]\nTONY STARK: And I... am... Iron Man.\n[Tony snaps his fingers with a loud \"CLANG\" and a blinding flash of white. Rocket fires at a Leviathan and before it devours him, it crumbles into ash. The Black Order starts crumbling to ash. T'Challa and Quill look around in surprise; Steve looks on in exhaustion, knowing that they have won. Thanos, in horror, looks around and sees his entire army disintegrate. He looks at Steve, who just stares at him. Thanos sits down and mourns before slowly being erased from existence himself.]\n[Cut back to Tony. The power of the gauntlet raw energy has left his entire right side fatally injured. He stumbles for a bit before his body collapses besides a pile of debris. Rhodey soon flies in and goes up to Tony to see his long time colleague and friend fading away. He bows his head, knowing the damage was done. Peter Parker soon flies in and sees Tony collapsed on the ground.]\nPETER PARKER: Mr. Stark? [He runs up to his fallen mentor. Tears start to form in his eyes] Hey... Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It's Peter. Hey. We won, Mr. Stark... We won, Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir. You did it.\n[Tony is unresponsive. Peter breaks down and hugs him.]\nPETER PARKER: I'm sorry... Tony...\n[Peter is gently led aside to grieve. Pepper Potts sits in front of the fading Iron Man.]\nPEPPER POTTS: Hey.\n[Tony is barely able to move his head, but manages to look Pepper in the eyes]\nTONY STARK: [quietly] Hey, Pep...\n[Pepper places her hand on Tony's Arc Reactor and Tony rests his hand on hers. Pepper takes a good look at Tony's fatal injuries.]\nPEPPER POTTS: F.R.I.D.A.Y.?\nF.R.I.D.A.Y.: Life functions critical.\n[Tony smiles with tears in his eyes.]\nPEPPER POTTS: Tony. Look at me. [She makes sure Tony gets a long look at her smiling face] We're gonna be okay. You can rest now.\n[With that acknowledgement, Tony's arc reactor flickers off for good. Pepper can no longer contain her grief and starts crying on his shoulder. Tony Stark, Iron Man, Earth's Best Defender, is dead.]\n[We cut to a montage showing reunions and celebrations. At Clint Barton's farm, he joyfully reunites with his family. At Peter Parker's school, Peter and Ned meet in the hallways. They share a handshake before giving each other a heartfelt hug. In San Francisco, Scott Lang watches fireworks with Cassie Lang and Hope Van Dyne. In Wakanda, T'Cahlla, Shuri, and Ramonda oversee the celebrations from their balcony. Over all this, we hear Tony's voice narrating.]\nTONY STARK (voiceover): Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back, and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you told me ten years ago that we weren't alone, let alone, you know, to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know? The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And, for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in.\n[Cut to the Stark household. Pepper, Morgan, Happy Hogan and Rhodey all watch Tony's holographic message being projected from his Iron Man helmet. Tony is sitting down recording the message.]\nTONY STARK (hologram): So I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... In the case of an untimely death on my part. I mean, not that, death at any time isn't untimely. This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it's... it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. That's the thing. Then again, that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. [Tony suddenly gets up walking towards his camera] What am I even trippin' for? Everything's gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. [He leans down and smiles. He is looking straight at Morgan] I love you 3,000.\n[The message ends and the hologram cuts out.]\n[Cut to outside the cottage. Pepper carries a wreath out of the house to an audience waiting outside for the intimate funeral. She lays the wreath on the lake. On top of the wreath is Tony's first arc reactor which Pepper had framed with the words \"Proof That Tony Stark Has a Heart\" back in 2008.

I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.\nMORGAN STARK: Okay.\n[Following the funeral for Tony, we cut to Thor and Valkyrie in New Asgard.]\nVALKYRIE: So, when can we expect you back?\nTHOR: Um... about that...\nVALKYRIE: Thor. Your people need a king.\nTHOR: No, they already have one.\nVALKYRIE: That's funny. You being serious?\n[Thor nods his head]\nTHOR: It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are.\nVALKYRIE: You know I'd make a lot of changes around here.\nTHOR: I'm counting on it.

It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.\nTHOR: Quail... you... that-that's your own-\nQUILL: Quail?\nTHOR: ... insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service and assisting.\nQUILL: Quill.\nTHOR: That's what I said.\nDRAX: You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.\nNEBULA: Sounds fair.\n[Quill looks around]\nQUILL: It's not necessary.\nTHOR: It's not.\nQUILL: Okay?\nROCKET: I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.\nMANTIS: [enthusiastically] Oh, yes. Please, use knives.\nDRAX: Yeah, knives.\nGROOT: I am Groot.\n[Both Thor and Quill laugh but Quill tries to laugh harder]\nQUILL: Not necessary.\nTHOR: Not nece-there shall be no knifing one another.

Of course.\n[Scene cuts to Bruce, Steve, Sam and Bucky at the woods]\nBRUCE BANNER: Now, remember... You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them.

Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it.\n[we see Tony writing a note 'You know who I am', and leaving it on the bedside table for Maya before leaving; Maya hears the door close]\nTony Stark: [voice over] Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.\n[Present Day, Malibu, California - Tony is in his lab injecting himself with some devices]\nJarvis: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...\nTony Stark: No. Forty-eight.[he injects himself]\nTony Stark: Ah!

You earned it.\n[Tony walks towards the robot]\nTony Stark: Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it.\nJarvis: Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.\n[addressing the Iron Man suits that are in their glass cages]\nTony Stark: Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suit. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother.\n[to Jarvis as he records Tony with a camera]\nTony Stark: Start tight and go wide, stamp in time.

Send 'em all.\n[the leg part flies over and attaches itself to Tony's leg, then as another part flies over it crashes into one of the Iron Man suit glass cages, then another part hurls itself at Tony and Tony inflects it with his arm making it crash]\nTony Stark: Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a...\n[suddenly another part of the suit shoots over and Tony ducks as it narrowly misses hitting him in the head]\nTony Stark: ...little bit.\n[the other parts fly over and attach themselves with force to Tony's back and crotch area]\nTony Stark: Cool it, will you, Jarvis?\n[then all the other parts shoot over and get attached to Tony, accept for the final face piece, which just hovers, facing Tony]\nTony Stark: Come on. I ain't scared of you.\n[the face piece flies over and Tony flips over to grab the piece and finally the Iron Man suit is fully attached to Tony]\nTony Stark: I'm the best.\n[at that moment, one of the stray pieces of the suit shoot over to Tony, knock hims down, which knocks the entire suit, except for the head piece, off Tony]\nJarvis: As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.\nTony Stark: [voice over] And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.\n[the news on TV shows footage of The Mandarin]\nTony Stark: [voice over] That's when he happened.\nThe Mandarin: Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuver, the braves were away. President Ellis you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming.\n[as this footage ends, the TV channels change and all the news channels are talking about The Mandarin]\n[the news on TV shows President Ellis addresses The Mandarin Threat]\nPresident Ellis: Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot.\n[we then see Bill Maher talking about this on his show]\nBill Maher: And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job.\n[then we see Joan Rivers on 'The Fashion Police' talking about the new Iron Man suit]\nJoan Rivers: Same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. Look at That. And they also renamed him Iron Patriot. You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.\n[Rhodes and Tony Stark are at a bar and they see Joan Rivers making fun of the Iron Patriot suit on TV]\nColonel James Rhodes: It tested well with focus groups, alright?\nTony Stark: [putting on a mocking voice] I am Iron Patriot...\nColonel James Rhodes: Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.\nTony Stark: So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?\n[Tony moves closer to Rhodes]\nColonel James Rhodes: It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.\nTony Stark: Nine.\nColonel James Rhodes: The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings.\nTony Stark: You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.\nColonel James Rhodes: When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?\nTony Stark: Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?\nColonel James Rhodes: People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.\nTony Stark: You're gonna come at me like that?\nColonel James Rhodes: No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic...\n[a girl and a boy come up to their table]\nColonel James Rhodes: ...tator.\nErin: Do you mind signing my drawing?\nTony Stark: If Richard doesn't mind.

After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not...\nTony Stark: It's superhero business, I get it.\nColonel James Rhodes: No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.\nTony Stark: That's why I said I...got it.\n[suddenly as Tony is signing the drawing he looks ill, he places his hand on his face]\nColonel James Rhodes: Are you okay?\nTony Stark: I broke the crayon.\nErin: Are you okay, Mr. Stark?\nColonel James Rhodes: Take it easy. Tony...\nLittle Boy: [the little boy whispers to Tony] How did you get out of the wormhole? How did you get out of the wormhole?\n[suddenly Tony rises and starts walking off]\nColonel James Rhodes: Wait a minute! Tony!\n[Rhodes follows Tony as he walks out the bar]\nTony Stark: What'd he say?!\nColonel James Rhodes: Tony!\nTony Stark: Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.\n[Tony steps into his Iron Man suit that was parked outside the bar]\nTony Stark: Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?\nJarvis: No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity\nTony Stark: Okay, so I was poisoned?\nJarvis: My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.\nTony Stark: Me?\n[Rhodes knocks on the Iron Suit's head, people have gathered around them watching Tony]\nColonel James Rhodes: Come on, man.

Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet, come on. [referring to Tony's robots as Hogan meets with Pepper] Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing party hats. This is an asset that we can put to use.\nPepper Potts: Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?\nHappy Hogan: What I'm saying is that the human element of Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. We should start phasing it out immediately.\nPepper Potts: What!?\nHappy Hogan: [to another employee as Hogan walks past them] Excuse me, Bambi.\nPepper Potts: [Hogan points to his badge] Did you just say that?\nHappy Hogan: Security.\nPepper Potts: Happy?\nHappy Hogan: Yes.\nPepper Potts: Okay, I am thrilled that you're now the Head of Security, okay? It is the perfect position for you.\nHappy Hogan: Thank you.\nPepper Potts: However...\nHappy Hogan: I do appreciate it\nPepper Potts: Since you've taken the post...\nHappy Hogan: You don't have to thank me.\nPepper Potts: We've had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent\nHappy Hogan: Thank you.\nPepper Potts: That's not a compliment.\nHappy Hogan: That's not a compli...? It is a compliment! Clearly somebody's trying to hide something.\nPepper Potts: I...\nPepper's Assistant: Excuse me.\nPepper Potts: Yes?\nPepper's Assistant: Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here.\nPepper Potts: Thank you.\nHappy Hogan: Did you clear this four o'clock with me?\nPepper Potts: Happy, we'll talk about this later. But right now I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.\n[Pepper starts walking towards her office]\nHappy Hogan: How so?\nPepper Potts: I used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. So it's a little awkward.\n[Hogan opens her office glass door and they enter]\nHappy Hogan: I don't like the sound of that.\n[as they step inside, they see Aldrich, looking handsome and fit in a business suit]\n[Pepper looks shocked at the change in Aldrich's appearance]\nAldrich Killian: Pepper.\nPepper Potts: Killian?\nAldrich Killian: You look great. You look really great.\nPepper Potts: God, you look...you look great. I... I...I can't... What on earth have you been doing?\nAldrich Killian: Nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. And please, call me Aldrich.\nHappy Hogan: Uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.\nPepper Potts: Happy, it's okay.\nHappy Hogan: Yes?\nPepper Potts: We're good.\nHappy Hogan: You sure?\nPepper Potts: Yes. Stand down.\nHappy Hogan: Okay. I'm gonna linger, right here.\nPepper Potts: Thank you.\nHappy Hogan: Okay.\n[Hogan steps out of Pepper's office and closes the glass door]\nPepper Potts: It's very nice to see you, Killian.\n[as Hogan waits outside Pepper's office, he sees Aldrich's man sitting in the waiting area]\nHappy Hogan: Hey, guy.\n[Hogan points to his security badge and the guy picks up his badge from the table next to him and holds it up to show Hogan he has a badge; to an employee as they walk past him]\nSavin: Merry Christmas.\n[Hogan looks at him with suspicion]\n[back in Pepper's office]\nAldrich Killian: After years dodging the President's ban on \"immoral biotech research\", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis. I'm gonna turn your lights down.\n[he dims the lights then holds in his hand three small metal balls]\nAldrich Killian: Regard the human brain.\n[he throws the balls onto the coffee table and as they roll and stop, they project a 3d image into the room]\nAldrich Killian: Uh...wait. Hold on, hold on. That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that...\n[he presses his projector control which changes the 3d image to show inside of the brain]\nAldrich Killian: That's the brain. Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?\nPepper Potts Wow, that's amazing!\nAldrich Killian: Thanks, it's mine.\nPepper Potts: What?\nAldrich Killian: This...you're inside my head. It's a...\n[he taps behind his ear, referring to something embedded inside his head]\nAldrich Killian: It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you.\n[Aldrich rises from the couch and stands on the coffee table]\nAldrich Killian: Come on.\n[he helps Pepper to stand on the coffee table next to him, they stand directly in the 3d image]\nAldrich Killian: Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me.\n[Pepper pinches him and immediately something lights up in the 3d image of Aldrich's brain]\nPepper Potts: What is that?\nAldrich Killian: It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you.\n[he turns Pepper round and presses his projector control and starts changing and moving the image with his hand]\nAldrich Killian: Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential And it goes...here. This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded.\nPepper Potts: Wow.\n[as Hogan sits outside Pepper's office, he gets a call on his tablet, he answers the call and holds the tablet high so the camera monitor shows his forehead and eyes]\nHappy Hogan: Hello?\nTony Stark: Is this forehead of Security?\nHappy Hogan: What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here.\n[we see Tony is in his lab]\nTony Stark: What? Harassing interns?\nHappy Hogan: Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man's body guard? They would laugh in my face.\n[Tony laughs]\nHappy Hogan: I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.\nTony Stark: What's going on? Fill me in.\nHappy Hogan: For real?\nTony Stark: Yeah.\nHappy Hogan: Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.\nTony Stark: Right.\nHappy Hogan: I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces.\nTony Stark: Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.\nHappy Hogan: Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?\nTony Stark: Um...Switzerland.\nHappy Hogan: Right, right, exactly.\nTony Stark: Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.\nHappy Hogan: Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.\nTony Stark: His what?\nHappy Hogan: Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See? [he holds his tablet up and points it towards Pepper's glass office, where Aldrich and Pepper are standing close together on the coffee table watching the 3d image of the brain, but all Tony sees is Hogan pointing the tablet camera at himself]\nTony Stark: Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.\nHappy Hogan: I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here.\nTony Stark: Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.\nHappy Hogan: I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen!Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.\n[as Hogan is talking, Tony uses his small tablet device to look up Aldrich and finds his photo]\nHappy Hogan: Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.\nTony Stark: Relax.\nHappy Hogan: Seriously?\nTony Stark: I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?\nHappy Hogan: You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.\nTony Stark: A giant brain?\nHappy Hogan: Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.\nTony Stark: I miss you, Happy.\nHappy Hogan: Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...\nTony Stark: Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?\nHappy Hogan: Why?\nTony Stark: I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.\n[he puts his small tablet in his wine fridge and closes it and walks off still with Hogan online]\nHappy Hogan: Yeah, nice.\n[back in Pepper's office after Aldrich has show her his new research]\nAldrich Killian: Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.\nPepper Potts: It would be incredible.\nAldrich Killian: Mm.\nPepper Potts: Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...\nAldrich Killian: Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego.\nPepper Potts: It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you.\n[we see Aldrich leaving the building]\nAldrich Killian: Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'\nPepper Potts: That's very deep.\nAldrich Killian: Mm\nPepper Potts: And I have no idea what it means.\nAldrich Killian: Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.\n[Pepper laughs]\nAldrich Killian: I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.\n[Aldrich kisses her gently on the cheek and Pepper watches him as he walks off, then Pepper notices Hogan coming toward her, Pepper looks flustered]\nPepper Potts: Happy...\nHappy Hogan: The car is ready, if you're ready to go.\n[Pepper glances over to Aldrich as he walks towards his car]\nPepper Potts: Yes. I just um...God, I forgot my other thing, so I'm just gonna...\n[she walks back into the building, Hogan glance over to Aldrich's car and as it drives away, Hogan takes a photo of the license plate]\n[later Pepper returns to Tony's home, as she gets out of the car she sees a large stuffed rabbit outside the house that Tony has bought for her as a gift, she walks inside]\nPepper Potts: I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!\n[she notices Tony sat in his Iron Man suit on the couch]\nPepper Potts: You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?\n[Tony looks at the small number marked 42 on the suit]\nTony Stark: Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.\nPepper Potts: Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?\n[Tony rises and walks toward her]\nTony Stark: Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.\n[Tony shakes his ass and Pepper laughs]\nTony Stark: Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?\nPepper Potts: Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?\nTony Stark: Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.\nPepper Potts: Okay.\nTony Stark: So, uh...tense? Good day?\n[Tony walks up behind her and starts massaging her shoulders]\nTony Stark: Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?\nPepper Potts: Did I like it?\nTony Stark: Nailed it, right?\nPepper Potts: Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.\n[Pepper turns to face Tony, she rises from her seat and stands close to him]\nPepper Potts: So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?\n[Tony knocks the metal helmet on his head]\nTony Stark: Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...\nPepper Potts: Uh-huh.\nTony Stark: The facial slit?\nPepper Potts: Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?\nTony Stark: Crowbar. Yeah.\n[Pepper starts walking towards Tony's lab]\nTony Stark: Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.\nPepper Potts: I'll take my chances.\nTony Stark: That's risky.\n[Pepper walks down the stairs to Tony's lab]\nTony Stark: At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.\n[Pepper sees Tony is in fact not in his Iron Man suit, but in the lab exercising as he remotely controls the suit, which follows Pepper into the lab]\nTony Stark: Busted.\nPepper Potts: This is a new level of lame.\nTony Stark: Sorry.\n[Pepper notices the food tray in the corner]\nPepper Potts: You ate without me, already? On date night?\nTony Stark: [referring to Mark 42 suit] He was just...\nPepper Potts: You mean you?\nTony Stark: Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.\nPepper Potts: Uh-huh.\nTony Stark: And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.\n[Mark 42 suit turns its face toward her, as if to look at her accusingly]\nPepper Potts: What?\nTony Stark: What?\nPepper Potts: Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?\nTony Stark: Happy was concerned.\nPepper Potts: No, you're spying on me.\nTony Stark: I wasn't...\nPepper Potts: I'm going to bed.\n[Pepper turns and starts walking off]\nTony Stark: Hold on. Come on. Pep.\n[as Pepper starts walking upstairs]\nTony Stark: Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.\n[Pepper stops and looks at him]\nTony Stark: I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.\n[Pepper walks back down]\nTony Stark: Nothing's been the same since New York.\nPepper Potts: Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.\nTony Stark: You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.\n[he pauses for a moment]\nTony Stark: But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh...\nPepper Potts: Machines.\nTony Stark: But they're part of me.\nPepper Potts: A distraction.\nTony Stark: Maybe.\n[Pepper walks towards Tony and they hold each other]\nPepper Potts: I'm gonna take a shower.\nTony Stark: Okay.\n[Pepper turns to walk off, then stops and looks at him]\nPepper Potts: And you're gonna join me.\nTony Stark: Better.\n[later that night, as Tony and Pepper are sleeping, Tony starts having nightmares about when he was in New York with The Avengers and had to get rid of the nuke in space, Pepper wakes and starts to shake Tony awake]\nPepper Potts: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...\n[suddenly Pepper gets grabbed and shoved off Tony by Mark 42 suit, this wakes Tony who commands the suit]\nTony Stark: Power down!\n[the suit shuts down and Tony hits it making its pieces fall apart, he looks over at Pepper who is in shock]\nTony Stark: I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?\n[Pepper rises and starts to leave]\nTony Stark: Don't go, alright? Pepper?\nPepper Potts: I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.\n[Pepper leaves the room]\n[at the Chinese theater in Los Angeles, we see Aldrich's henchman meet a man who's sat outside the theater]\nSavin: Can you regulate?\nTaggert: Yes, I can regulate.\nSavin: Are you sure about that?\nTaggert: Yes.\n[Hogan who's been following Savin, keeps an eye on him from a distance, he sees Savin giving the man a briefcase]\nSavin: It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.\nTaggert: Thank you...I mean for understanding.\n[Savin walks off, Hogan walks towards Taggert and as Taggert rises to leave Hogan bumps into him which knock the briefcase out of Taggert's hand, falling open on to the ground]\nHappy Hogan: I'm sorry, buddy.\n[Hogan helps him put the stuff back in the suitcase, and as he looks at Taggert he notices that he is glowing red, Hogan starts to walk off taking one of the items from the suitcase, but suddenly Savin bumps into him]\nSavin: What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?\nHappy Hogan: Yeah, a little movie called \"The Party's Over\", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket. [Hogan shows him what he took from Taggert's suitcase]\nSavin: No kidding? That doesn't belong to you. [Savin goes to take the item from Hogan's hand, but Hogan punches Savin in the face, Hogan notices Savin's face glow red and heal, then Savin grabs hold of Hogan and with super strength throws him aside, as Savin walks towards Hogan, Taggert begins to glow red and turn super hot]\nTaggert: Savin!\nSavin: What?\nTaggert: Help! Help me! [Taggert suddenly explodes, causing a massive explosion inside the theater which wounds Hogan, as he lies injured, Hogan sees Savin, also glowing red and then healing and walking off as if nothing has happened] [we see another TV footage from The Mandarin]\nThe Mandarin: True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation. [as Hogan lies in hospital critically injured, Tony is sat in his room when a nurse walks in to check on Hogan]\nTony Stark: Hi.\nHappy's Nurse: Oh.\nTony Stark: [referring to the TV] Uh...mind leaving that on?\nHappy's Nurse: Sure. [Tony rises from his seat]\nTony Stark: Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. [he pauses for a moment] One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them. [Tony turns to leave] [news reporters are all waiting for Tony outside the hospital]\nHospital News Reporter: We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack. [Tony walks out and all the reporters swarm toward him] Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Our sources are telling us that this is another Mandarin attack. Anything else you can tell us? [Tony ignores the questions and walks toward his car]\nPushy Tabloid Reporter: Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'. [Tony turns to face the reporter]\nTony Stark: Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10880, Malibu Port, 90265. I'll leave the door unlocked. [to the reporter] Bill me. [Tony gets in his car and drives off] [as Tony is working his lab]\nJarvis: I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [Tony starts looking at all the data gathered]\nTony Stark: Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning \"adviser to the King\". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. [Tony pushes the virtual information down to close] Close. [Tony looks at the virtual crime scene reconstruction]\nJarvis: The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.\nTony Stark: No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.\nJarvis: No, sir.\nTony Stark: Talk to me, Happy. [in the virtual reconstruction, Tony sees Hogan pointing his finger at some dog tags] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] Any military victims?\nJarvis: Not according to public records, sir.\nTony Stark: Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.\nJarvis: The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.\nTony Stark: Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. [Tony looks at the information popping up] Nope. [he sees an attack in Rose Hill, Tennessee] That. You sure that's not one of his?\nJarvis: It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.\nTony Stark: Bring it around.\nJarvis: The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. [Tony looks at all the information being presented on the Tennessee attack]\nTony Stark: That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?\nJarvis: Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. [as Tony is about to get ready to leave for Tennessee, he hears his door bell ring]\nTony Stark: Are we still at \"ding-dong\"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?\nJarvis: There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. [we see Maya standing outside Tony's house, the glass doors are opened and she enters]\nTony Stark: Right there's fine. [Tony dressed in his Iron Man suit walks toward her] You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?\nMaya Hansen: You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?\nTony Stark: Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.\nJarvis: Gluten-free waffles, sir.\nTony Stark: That's right.\nMaya Hansen: Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.\nTony Stark: Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. [as he turns to walk into the living room, two bags are thrown down from the above balcony] It's...with her.\nPepper Potts: Tony, is somebody there? [Tony steps out of his suit]\nTony Stark: Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. [as Pepper starts walking downstairs, Tony moves towards Maya and speaks quietly] Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.\nMaya Hansen: He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.\nTony Stark: What...what for? Why now?\nMaya Hansen: Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.\nTony Stark: I'll be fine.\nPepper Potts: I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.\nTony Stark: We weren't.\nMaya Hansen: No, I...\nPepper Potts: And old girlfriends!\nTony Stark: She's not really.\nMaya Hansen: No, not really. It...it was just one night.\nTony Stark: Yep.\nPepper Potts: That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.\nTony Stark: It was a great night.\nPepper Potts: Well, you know...\nMaya Hansen: Yeah.\nPepper Potts: You have saved yourself a world of pain.\nMaya Hansen: I'm sure.\nTony Stark: What?\nPepper Potts: Trust me. [to Tony] We're going out of town.\nTony Stark: Okay, we've been through this. Nope.\nPepper Potts: Yep!\nTony Stark: The man says no.\nPepper Potts: Immediately and indefinitely!\nTony Stark: Honey...\nMaya Hansen: Great idea. Let's go. I'll...\nTony Stark: I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.\nPepper Potts: Tony, this is how normal people behave.\nTony Stark: I can't protect you out there. I challenged... [Maya notices giant stuffed rabbit Tony had bought for Pepper]\nMaya Hansen: Is...is that normal?\nTony Stark: Yes, this is normal!\nPepper Potts: Sadly, that...is very normal.\nTony Stark: It's a big bunny, relax about it!\nPepper Potts: Calm down!\nTony Stark: I got this for you.\nPepper Potts: I'm aware of that.\nTony Stark: You still haven't even told me that you liked it!\nPepper Potts: I don't like it!\nTony Stark: I asked you three... You don't like it?! [as Tony and Pepper are bickering, Maya notices on the TV that helicopters are coming toward Tony's home]\nPepper Potts: Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.\nTony Stark: I said no.\nMaya Hansen: Guys, can we um...\nTony Stark: What?\nMaya Hansen: [she points to the bomb heading straight for the house, the house is suddenly hit, as everything explodes around them, Tony manages to get his Iron Man suit onto Pepper to protect her from the fall, Tony looks over to Maya, who's lying unconscious on the ground, as the ceiling is about to fall on Tony, Pepper saves him with the Iron Man suit] Do we need to worry about that?\nPepper Potts: I got you.\nTony Stark: I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here. [the helicopters starts shooting at the house] Move! I'm right behind! [as they run to get out, the floor in front of Tony collapses, Pepper manages to get on the other side] Get her, I'm gonna find a way around. [Pepper hesitates] Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go! [Pepper manages to grab Maya and use the Iron Man suit to get them safely out of the house, but the house gets further destroyed as the helicopters continue to fire on it]\nPepper Potts: Oh my God. Tony! [back inside as the house is being destroyed around Tony]\nJarvis: Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure. [Tony motions for his Iron Man suit to come off Pepper and onto him]\nTony Stark: Jarvis, where's my flight power?!\nJarvis: Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. [Tony manages to use his suit to destroy one of the helicopters]\nTony Stark: That's one.\nJarvis: Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [Tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter]\nTony Stark: That's two. [as the helicopter explodes it crashes into the house, the remaining helicopter continues on shooting at the house, finally the remains of house with Tony inside fall into the ocean, Pepper runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down into the ocean] Tony! [in the water, Tony starts to feel like he's drowning]\nJarvis: Sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments Tony's suit gets its flight power activated by Jarvis] Flight power restored. [finally Tony manages to fly out of the ocean [inside the suit Jarvis tries to wake Tony] Sir. Sir!\nTony Stark: Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.\nJarvis: That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [Tony notices that he's flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath]\nTony Stark: It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?\nJarvis: We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.\nTony Stark: Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...\nJarvis: I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.\nTony Stark: Who asked you? Open the suit.\nJarvis: I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.\nTony Stark: Open eject. [the suit gets off Tony and he sits up] That's brisk! [as Tony starts to feel the cold weather] Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.\nJarvis: I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power]\nTony Stark: Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. [Tony drags the suit to a petrol station and makes a call to Pepper]\nComputer Voice: Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.\nTony Stark: Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. [Tony drags the suit to an abandoned looking farmhouse, he places the suit on a couch and sits next to it] Let's get you comfy. [he places its hand by its side] You happy now? [as Tony tries to fix the micro-repeater implants in his arm a boy stands by the doorway and points his toy gun at Tony]\nHarley Keener: Freeze! Don't move.\nTony Stark: You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. [the boy points his gun at a glass on a shelf and shoots at it, breaking the glass] And now you're out of ammo.\nHarley Keener: What's that thing on your chest?\nTony Stark: It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.\nHarley Keener: What does it power? [Tony stands and points the desk light at his suit sitting on the couch behind him] Oh my God! [Harley drops his toy gun and takes a step towards Tony] That...that's... Is that Iron Man?\nTony Stark: Technically, I am.\nHarley Keener: Technically, you're dead. [he give Tony a newspaper which has Tony's picture with the headline 'Mandarin Attack: Stark presumed dead']\nTony Stark: A valid point.\nHarley Keener: [referring to the suit as he sits next to it on the couch checking it out] What happened to him?\nTony Stark: Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.\nHarley Keener: Like a mechanic?\nTony Stark: Yeah.\nHarley Keener: Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine...\nTony Stark: It's Iron Patriot now.\nHarley Keener: That's way cooler!\nTony Stark: No, it's not.\nHarley Keener: Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...\nTony Stark: Retroreflective panels?\nHarley Keener: To make him stealth mode.\nTony Stark: You want a stealth mode?\nHarley Keener: Cool, right?\nTony Stark: That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.\nHarley Keener: [as he touches the suit, Harley accidentally snaps off one of its fingers] Oops!\nTony Stark: Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.\nHarley Keener: Sorry.\nTony Stark: Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?\nHarley Keener: Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.\nTony Stark: Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.\nHarley Keener: What's in it for me?\nTony Stark: Salvation. What's his name?\nHarley Keener: Who?\nTony Stark: The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?\nHarley Keener: How'd you know that?\nTony Stark: I got just the thing. [he opens a compartment on the suit and takes out a metal object] This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. [Harley reaches out to take it, but Tony pulls his hand away] Deal? Deal? What'd you say?\nHarley Keener: Deal.\nTony Stark: Deal? [Tony gives the object to Harley] What's you're name?\nHarley Keener: Harley. And you're...\nTony Stark: The mechanic. Tony [Tony looks at Harley for a moment] You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich? back at Tony's house, which is now surrounded by emergency rescue and news reporters, Pepper stands alone and looks at one of Tony's shattered Iron Man helmets, she notices a red flashing light inside the helmet and as she puts the helmet on she receives the message Tony had left her earlier] Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. [later that night as Pepper drives Maya home]\nPepper Potts: Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?\nMaya Hansen: I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.\nPepper Potts: Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so...\nMaya Hansen: That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist.\nPepper Potts: This boss of yours, does he have a name?\nMaya Hansen: Yeah, Aldrich Killian. [Pepper looks at her in shock] [we see Aldrich talking on the phone to Savin]\nSavin: Well, we took the house down, sir...\nAldrich Killian: Mmhmm.\nSavin: But there's no sign of a body.\nAldrich Killian: I see.\nSavin: No Stark.\nAldrich Killian: I have to go. [Aldrich rises from his seat walks towards another room] The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done. [Aldrich walks into a room which has been set up as a set with all of Mandarin's props in place and camera crew ready to record Mandarin's message] Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face. [we then see the Mandarin arrive with his entourage and enter the house]\nMandarin Look-Out: The Master is traveling. [the Mandarin arrives on set and takes a sit, he looks at Aldrich]\nThe Mandarin: Well then, what are we waiting for? [in Rose Hills, Tennessee, Tony and Harley walk in town at night]\nTony Stark: The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. [he pulls his sleeve up and we see he's wearing a little girl's pink watch, Harley laughs]\nHarley Keener: She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?\nTony Stark: Maybe never, relax about it.\nHarley Keener: What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?\nTony Stark: I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. [they stop and Tony looks at the remains of the local explosion site that Tony came to investigate] What's the official story here? What happened?\nHarley Keener: I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. [Tony looks around at the remains]\nTony Stark: Six people died, right?\nHarley Keener: Yeah.\nTony Stark: Including Chad Davis?\nHarley Keener: Yeah. [Tony keeps looking around at the remains of the explosion site]\nTony Stark: Yeah. That doesn't make sense. [he sits next to Harley] Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.\nHarley Keener: Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.\nTony Stark: Do you buy that?\nHarley Keener: That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?\nTony Stark: No idea. I'm not...I don't care.\nHarley Keener: That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?\nTony Stark: That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.\nHarley Keener: Are they coming back? The aliens?\nTony Stark: Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?\nHarley Keener: Does this subject make you...make you edgy?\nTony Stark: Yeah, a little bit.

[Tony opens the file]\nTony Stark: Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?\nMrs. Davis: Yeah. [Tony looks at the file again and notices a photo of Taggart next to the photo of Chad]\nTony Stark: Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.\nMrs. Davis: What?\nTony Stark: As a weapon.\nMrs. Davis: You're not the person who called me after all, are you? [suddenly a cell phone is slammed on their table]\nBrandt: Actually, I am.

[Tony smashes into the window of a shop] [as Tony and Brandt are fighting in the shop, Tony starts a fire in shop] You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. [Tony puts Chad's dog tags into the microwave and he turns on the gas]\nBrandt: That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?\nTony Stark: Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. [Tony quickly leaves through the back door, as the dog tags heat up in the microwave they start sparking up fire, Brandt realizes the gas has been left on and suddenly the shop explodes killing Brandt] [Tony finds the Savin has grabbed Harley]\nHarley Keener: Let me go!
