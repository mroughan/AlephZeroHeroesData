# AlephZeroHeroesData

## Data from [aleph-zero-heroes](http://www.aleph-zero-heroes.info/)

Somewhat minimal to start with, but the plan is to put all data here.

## CSV

At the moment, these are vanilla CSV, but I will be doing a few other
things along the way.

## Code 

Code may make its way here as well, if its actually useful to anyone.

## To Do

Eventually there will be a DOI or paper, or other formal reference point if you want to refer to this. Haven't quite got there yet.
