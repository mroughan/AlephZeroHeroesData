# AlephZeroHeroesData

## Data from [aleph-zero-heroes](http://bandicoot.maths.adelaide.edu.au/public/aleph-zero-heroes/)

Somewhat minimal to start with, but the plan is to put all data here.

## CSV

At the moment, these are vanilla CSV, but I will be doing a few other
things along the way.

## Code 

Code may make its way here as well, if its actually useful to anyone.
